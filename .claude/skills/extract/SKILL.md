name: extract
description: Crawl an existing website (capped, multi-page) and seed stardust/current/ with PRODUCT.md, DESIGN.md, DESIGN.json, a per-page inventory, and the consolidated brand surface — the captured design system, palette, typography, motifs, and voice of the live site. Use when the user wants to analyze an existing site's design, extract or reverse-engineer its design system or brand, capture design tokens from a live site, import a website as the starting point for a redesign, capture the current state before a migration, or invokes /stardust:extract. Trigger phrases include "analyze this site", "extract the design tokens", "capture the brand", "crawl the site", "reverse engineer the design". Not for scraping page data or content for its own sake (it captures design evidence, not datasets), and not for the redesign itself — extraction is descriptive; direction and prototyping happen downstream.

# stardust:extract

Crawl an existing website, parse each page, extract the brand surface,
and produce a stardust-formatted snapshot of the current state under
`stardust/current/`. The output describes what the site **is**; later
sub-commands consume it to decide what it **should be**.

This skill is **descriptive**: it does not invent direction, it does not
critique, and it does not modify the live site. It writes only under
`stardust/current/` and updates `stardust/state.json`.

## Inputs

- `<url>` — required. The origin to crawl. Examples: `https://example.com`,
  `https://example.com/shop`. A path narrows the same-origin crawl to
  that subtree.
- `--cap <N>` — optional. Override the default 5-page cap. The cap
  is intentionally small — a 5-page sample (home + four IA
  pillars/templates) is enough for cross-page brand aggregation,
  system-component detection, and the brand-review HTML to do
  useful work. Lift the cap with `--cap 25` (the previous default)
  or higher when a deeper crawl is genuinely needed.
- `--all` — optional. Lift the cap entirely; extract every
  discovered page after junk filtering. Equivalent to `--cap 0`.
  Use when the user spontaneously asks for a full crawl.
- `--pages <slug,slug,...>` — optional. Restrict the crawl to specific
  paths (slugs derived per `reference/ia-extraction.md`). Bypasses
  the cap.
- `--refresh <slug>` — optional. Re-extract one page that already exists
  in `state.json`.
- `--single` — optional. Equivalent to `--cap 1`. Useful for testing.
- `--wait <fast|medium|spec|auto>` — optional. Wait strategy per page.
  Default `medium`. See `reference/playwright-recipe.md` § Wait modes.
- `--no-junk-filter` — optional. Disable the default junk-page filter
  in discovery (see `reference/ia-extraction.md` § Filtering).
- `--no-consent-dismiss` — optional. Skip the pre-flight consent /
  cookie banner dismissal (see `reference/playwright-recipe.md`
  § Pre-flight: consent dismissal). Use when the redesign scope
  explicitly includes the consent surface, or when the
  dismissal's side-effects (script activation that wouldn't
  otherwise run) need to be avoided. Default behaviour is to
  dismiss; the contract preserves screenshots, voice
  aggregation, and per-section style from being polluted by
  the banner.
- `--concurrency <n>` — optional. Parallel browser contexts for the
  per-page capture loop. Default 4; sane range 4–8. See
  § Concurrency.
- `--brand-source <url>` — optional, repeatable. An additional
  **same-brand** origin whose brand surface enriches the primary
  extraction (shallow capture: home + up to 2 nav-linked pages).
  See § Cross-site brand sources.
- `--design-source <url>` — optional. Design-donor origin: its
  design system is captured to `stardust/canon-source/` and becomes
  the fixed redesign target while the primary origin supplies
  content. See § Cross-site brand sources.
- `--prep` — optional. Run in **migrate-prep mode**: lift the cap,
  type each page, detect module candidates, capture typed content
  slots, emit the prep summary. See § Prep mode below. Typically
  invoked via the `prepare-migration` orchestrator skill rather
  than directly.

## Setup

Run the master skill's setup procedure first
(`skills/stardust/SKILL.md` § Setup): impeccable dep check, context
loader, state read.

Additional checks for this sub-command:

1. **Playwright availability.** The extraction step needs a real
   browser. Detect Playwright in this order: a Playwright MCP server,
   then a project-importable `playwright` module. **The `npx
   playwright` probe is NOT sufficient** — it confirms the CLI
   (which resolves a global install) but the recipe and
   `scripts/crawl.mjs` do `import { chromium } from 'playwright'`,
   and ESM module resolution does **not** honour a global install or
   `NODE_PATH`. On a vanilla `aem-boilerplate` target (no
   `node_modules`) that import throws `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` even
   though `npx playwright --version` succeeds. So verify the module is
   import-resolvable from the project root (probe:
   `node -e "import('playwright').then(()=>process.exit(0))"`); if it
   isn't, run `npm i -D playwright --no-save --legacy-peer-deps` (or
   use the Playwright MCP server) before crawling. The
   `--legacy-peer-deps` flag is required on `aem-boilerplate` targets
   — its pinned `eslint@8` conflicts with `@babel/eslint-parser@8`'s
   peer range and a plain `npm i` exits `ERESOLVE` before playwright
   is even considered (six-site e2e finding). Don't trust the CLI
   probe alone.

   **`--no-save` installs are ephemeral (stardust-style e2e
   finding).** Any later real `npm i` (e.g. deploy's bootstrap
   adding a devDependency) prunes non-manifest packages, silently
   removing playwright mid-pipeline. Every downstream skill that
   renders (prototype, migrate, deploy, diff) must re-run the
   import-resolvability probe — and re-install on failure — at the
   start of its own run, not assume extract's install survived.

   **Script location matters.** ESM resolves `import 'playwright'`
   from the *script's* directory, and the plugin tree ships no
   `node_modules` — so running `crawl.mjs` from the plugin path
   throws `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` even when the project has playwright
   installed. Copy the script byte-identical into the project
   (`stardust/scripts/crawl.mjs`) and run the copy; it resolves
   against the project's `node_modules`.

   **Bundled crawler.** `skills/extract/scripts/crawl.mjs` is a
   runnable reference implementation of this whole sub-command —
   browser config + bot-management fallback, consent dismissal, wait
   + scroll, the capture list, per-page full-page screenshots
   (`assets/screenshots/<slug>.png`, consumed by the Phase 2.5
   vision gate), response validation, and the §
   Capture-hygiene hardening (visibility filter, interstitial drop,
   SPA-shell flag, modal `textContent` capture, tracking-pixel
   discounting, cross-page duplicate detection). Prefer invoking it
   (`node skills/extract/scripts/crawl.mjs --url <origin> [--pages …]
   [--max N] [--concurrency N]`) over hand-rolling a Playwright
   script per run; extend
   its in-page `capture()` to cover any recipe field it doesn't yet
   emit.
2. **Origin collision.** If `stardust/state.json` already records
   `site.originUrl` and the new `<url>` is a different origin, stop and
   ask before clobbering. Stardust does not silently mix two sites in
   one project.
3. **Browser contexts.** Open a fresh `BrowserContext` per capture
   worker (§ Concurrency; default 4). Run the **consent dismissal
   pre-flight** per `reference/playwright-recipe.md` § Pre-flight:
   consent dismissal *unless* `--no-consent-dismiss` is set.
   Cookies persist within a context but **not across contexts** —
   re-establish consent state per context (re-run the dismissal on
   the worker's first page, or clone the probe context's
   `storageState`). Record the resolved method in
   `_crawl-log.json#consent.method`.
4. **Bot-management probe.** When the first navigation in the run
   returns `ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR` or `ERR_QUIC_PROTOCOL_ERROR`,
   or hangs through the entire hard-cap on what should be a fast
   origin, **do not retry headless**. Switch to
   `headless: false, channel: 'chrome'` per
   `reference/playwright-recipe.md` § Bot-management fallback and
   record the switch in `_crawl-log.json#discovery.fetchTechnique`
   so re-runs start in headed mode without rediscovering the
   issue.

## Procedure

### Phase 1 — Discovery

Discover the page inventory before crawling. Procedure in
`reference/ia-extraction.md`. In summary:

1. Fetch `<origin>/sitemap.xml`, then `<origin>/sitemap_index.xml`,
   then check `robots.txt` for `Sitemap:` directives.
2. If no sitemap is reachable, run a same-origin BFS crawl from
   `<url>`, depth-limited to 3, link-extracting from rendered HTML.
3. Filter the discovered URL list: same origin only, exclude
   `mailto:`, `tel:`, anchor-only links, query-only variations,
   common asset paths (`.css`, `.js`, `.pdf`, image extensions).
4. De-duplicate trailing-slash variations.
5. Apply the junk-page filter (`reference/ia-extraction.md` §
   Junk-page filter) unless `--no-junk-filter` is set. Surface the
   filtered list to the user as overridable.
6. Apply the cap (default 5, or `--cap`, or `--all` for no cap)
   and **proceed silently**. Print an informational summary of
   what was kept and what was cut — but do **not** gate on user
   confirmation. The default cap is small enough that the common
   case is "extract 5 pages and move on"; pausing for a yes/no
   reply on every run is friction without value. Users who want
   different scope set it spontaneously at command time:

   ```
   $stardust extract https://example.com              # default 5 pages
   $stardust extract https://example.com --cap 25     # bump to 25
   $stardust extract https://example.com --all        # lift the cap
   $stardust extract https://example.com --pages home,about,pricing
   $stardust extract https://example.com --single     # just the entry URL
   ```

   The agent reads spontaneous scope intent from the user's prompt
   (e.g. "extract all pages", "look at just the home and pricing",
   "do a full crawl") and applies the equivalent flag. No
   re-confirmation needed once intent is clear.

   Informational output (not a prompt — proceed immediately):

   ```
   Discovered 38 pages on https://example.com (sitemap.xml).
   Filtered as likely junk (5): /test/, /sample-page/, /holiday1/, ...
   Selecting 5 highest-priority pages:
     - / (home)
     - /about
     - /pricing
     - /products
     - /contact

   Cut (28 pages, --all to lift): /blog/post-1, /blog/post-2, ...

   Extracting...
   ```

   Selection heuristic: page-type checklist first, then score-based
   ranking (home + IA-pillar keywords + sitemap priority − archive /
   version markers). See `reference/ia-extraction.md` § Page
   selection and § Priority for the cap. The English-only keyword
   list is a known limitation for localized sites.

7. Write the discovered list to `stardust/current/_crawl-log.json`
   (created if absent) with `_provenance` and the full discovery
   reasoning, including `filteredAsJunk[]` and `userChoice`. This is
   an audit trail, not a state file.

### Phase 2 — Per-page extraction

For each page in the cap-respecting list, render with Playwright
following `reference/playwright-recipe.md`. Captures run
**concurrently**: the page queue is drained by `--concurrency`
parallel browser contexts (default 4, sane range 4–8), each applying
the full recipe independently; media `resolves` / HEAD checks are
batched with `Promise.all`. See § Concurrency. The recipe is
mandatory per page — in particular, do not skip the wait, scroll, or
capture-list steps:

- Viewport 1440 × 900 @ 2× DPR
- Wait per the configured wait mode (default `medium`; see § Wait
  modes in `reference/playwright-recipe.md`)
- Disable animations via `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`
- After the wait resolves, scroll to bottom in 4 viewport-height
  steps with 300 ms pauses, then return to top — this is required
  to trigger lazy-load and IntersectionObserver-driven content
- Record `waitMs` and `waitMode` in the per-page `_provenance`

Capture per page (full schema in `reference/current-state-schema.md`):

- Page metadata (title, meta description, OG tags, theme-color)
- Semantic structure: heading outline, landmark roles, sections
- **Hero headline + lede (resolved)** — `heroHeadline` / `heroLede`
  picked by font-size × hero-region with a junk/hidden-state filter and
  a clean meta-description fallback (per `reference/playwright-recipe.md`
  § Capture list 5-bis). Required for JS-rendered enterprise CMSes,
  where document-order headings surface modal / promo / count junk
  instead of the real tagline.
- Content: visible text per section (full innerText, **no
  truncation** per `reference/playwright-recipe.md` § Capture
  list 7), structured paragraphs (`body[]`), lists, FAQ Q/A
  pairs, and review/testimonial quotes per
  § Capture list 7-bis. Without these structured fields,
  every body region under a heading falls back to placeholder
  signature at migrate time.
- CTA labels and href targets, link inventory (internal vs external)
- Per-section computed style summary: dominant colors, font families
  in use, spacing rhythm, border-radius, shadows
- Media inventory: img with `currentSrc`/`srcset` captured **with
  query strings intact** plus a `resolves` flag (HEAD/GET with browser
  UA + Referer), intrinsic dimensions, inline SVG count, video/iframe
  presence, `cssBackgrounds[]` (including pseudo-element `::before`/
  `::after` walks per § Capture list 11) so `background-image`
  heroes and motifs do not silently disappear from extract — and so
  enterprise-CDN images that 404 are flagged before migrate ships
  `about:error`.
- Font files captured via network-intercept (per § Capture list
  16): every `woff2`/`woff`/`ttf`/`otf` response saved under
  `assets/fonts/` and recorded in `_brand-extraction.json#type.files[]`
  with licensing flag.
- Icon-font detection (per § Capture list 17): when the page
  uses `[class^="icon-"]` with non-default `::before`
  font-family + codepoint, capture the family, save the file,
  and record the `iconClass → codepoint` table in
  `_brand-extraction.json#iconFont`.
- Interactive elements: forms (with field types), buttons, modals
  detected by ARIA roles
- Full-page screenshot to `assets/screenshots/<slug>.png` —
  script-captured by the bundled crawler after the wait/scroll
  settle (viewport-only fallback on extremely tall pages; mode in
  `_signals.screenshotMode`, relative path in the page JSON
  `screenshot` field)

Save to `stardust/current/pages/<slug>.json` with `_provenance` as the
first key. Save referenced media to `stardust/current/assets/media/`
preserving basename plus a short content hash.

**Live-render evidence (synthesis is forbidden).** Refuse to mark
a page `extracted` in `state.json` unless its `_provenance`
contains `renderedBy: "playwright"`, an ISO-8601 `fetchedAt`, a
positive integer `waitMs`, a `waitMode` from the recipe, and a
final `httpStatus` in the 2xx/3xx range. These five fields are
the contract enforced by `reference/current-state-schema.md`
§ Live-render evidence and read back by every downstream phase
via `validateProvenance()` per
`skills/stardust/reference/state-machine.md` § Provenance
validation. Synthesizing a page record from
`_brand-extraction.json` plus URL patterns plus captured photos
— the 2026-04-30 lovesac shortcut — is the failure mode this
guard exists to prevent. When the agent (or a delegated sub-
agent) cannot satisfy the contract for a page, treat the page
as a Phase 2 failure: record under `_crawl-log.json#crawl.failures[]`
with `errorClass: "ProvenanceMissing"` and continue.

Mark the page `extracted` in `state.json` immediately after each
successful page write. If a page fails, record the error in
`_crawl-log.json` and continue — extraction is best-effort per page.

### Phase 2.5 — Vision verification

Before anything downstream is authored, **look** at each captured
page's screenshot (`assets/screenshots/<slug>.png`) — the multimodal
model reads the image — and verify it against the extracted record:

- Does the recorded hero (headline + asset) match what the pixels show?
- Is the extracted palette plausible against the pixels?
- Does a `cssBackgrounds: []` record look believable, or is imagery
  visibly present — a silent capture failure?
- Is the logo captured?
- Is the page actually rendered — not a consent wall, bot-block
  page, or blank SPA shell?

On mismatch, re-run that page's capture with the escalation ladder
before proceeding: bump the wait mode one step
(`reference/playwright-recipe.md` § Wait modes), then headed Chrome
(§ Bot-management fallback), then a fresh browser context. Record
the outcome per page in `_crawl-log.json#visionCheck[]`:

```json
{ "slug": "pricing", "verdict": "recaptured", "notes": "record said zero CSS backgrounds; screenshot shows a full-bleed photo hero" }
```

`verdict` is `"ok" | "recaptured" | "suspect"` — `suspect` means the
mismatch survived the ladder; downstream phases treat that record as
unreliable. Vision is the **authoritative** capture check; the
heuristic defenses (low-media flag, `spaShellSuspect`, duplicate
hash) remain as cheap early signals but no longer gate alone.

### Phase 3 — Brand-surface extraction

Run after the capture phases (2–2.5). Aggregation **may proceed
incrementally** as concurrent page captures complete (§ Concurrency),
but the written file must reflect every extracted page — including
brand-source pages per § Cross-site brand sources.
Produces `stardust/current/_brand-extraction.json`
per `reference/brand-surface.md`. Some fields are home-only (logo,
voice samples, register heuristic); the visual tokens that drive
DESIGN.md (palette, radius, shadow, type) are aggregated across **all
extracted pages** to avoid the home-page bias documented in
`brand-surface.md` § Aggregation scope. Captures:

- **Logo** by the v1 priority chain: inline SVG → `<img>` with
  logo-ish class/id → `apple-touch-icon` → `og:image` → favicon →
  synthesized placeholder. Save to `stardust/current/assets/logo.<ext>`.
- **Palette** — aggregate computed colors across **all extracted
  pages** (background, text, accents, borders, hovers). Frequency-sort,
  cluster near-duplicates, emit a role-named list (background, surface,
  text, primary, secondary, accent).
- **Type** — font families in use with their weights, sizes, and
  computed line-heights. Identify the heading family vs body family.
  Run the modular-scale audit (`brand-surface.md` § Modular-scale
  audit) and emit `scaleAudit.kind = "modular" | "ad-hoc"`.
- **Motifs** — signature border-radius (cross-page mode of non-zero
  values, weighted by element count), shadow stack (top 3 distinct,
  cross-page), gradient inventory, common patterns (chip, badge,
  card, hero-with-image). When the home-only mode disagrees with the
  cross-page mode, surface the divergence in `_provenance.notes`.
- **Voice samples** — first paragraph of body copy, the hero headline,
  3 representative CTA labels, a representative link list. Used by
  `direct` later but extracted now so the network round-trip is over.
- **Hero image** — elevate the home page's primary visual
  asset to `voice.heroImage` (per `reference/brand-surface.md`
  § heroImage resolution). Without this elevation, downstream
  prototype reasons over a 16-image list and frequently picks
  the `og:image` instead of the live hero.
- **Hero medium (signature)** — when the hero/first viewport carries a
  *moving* asset (background `<video>` / HLS / canvas / WebGL /
  Lottie / animated SVG / scroll-driven motion), elevate it to
  `voice.heroMedium` (per `reference/brand-surface.md` § heroMedium
  resolution). This is the page's **signature**; without elevation it
  is lost in the raw media list and downstream prototype flattens it
  to a static hero. A non-null `heroMedium` triggers signature
  preservation (`skills/stardust/reference/intent-dimensions.md`
  § 8b) at prototype time.
- **Icon font** — when detected per `reference/playwright-recipe.md`
  § Capture list 17, populate `_brand-extraction.json#iconFont`
  with family, file path, and the `iconClass → codepoint`
  table so prototypes can render the brand's actual icons.
- **System components** — cross-page repeated DOM blocks (site
  header, site footer, cross-promo strips, persistent CTAs,
  breadcrumbs). Detected by heading-sequence + CTA-label fingerprint
  per `reference/brand-surface.md` § System components. Required —
  these are usually the most load-bearing surfaces and must not
  silently disappear from the redesign target.
- **Origins** — one entry per contributing origin in
  `_brand-extraction.json#origins[]` per `reference/brand-surface.md`
  § Origins. Single-origin runs emit a one-entry array; brand-source
  runs attribute widened evidence per origin.

Do not invent values. Every captured value cites a source selector or
URL in `_brand-extraction.json` for traceability.

### Phase 4 — Seed `stardust/current/PRODUCT.md` and `DESIGN.md`

The current-state PRODUCT.md and DESIGN.md are **descriptive, not
authored** — there is no interview to run because the user is not
defining intent here, the agent is describing the existing site. Write
them directly using impeccable's format specs:

- For PRODUCT.md, follow the section structure in impeccable's
  `reference/teach.md`. Populate `Register` from the brand surface
  (sites that read as marketing/landing → `brand`; tools/dashboards →
  `product`; ambiguous → `brand` with a note). Populate `Users`,
  `Product Purpose`, `Brand Personality`, `Anti-references`, and
  `Design Principles` from the captured copy and the brand surface.
  Where the agent must infer, mark the section with `_provenance:
  inferred` and a one-line basis sentence.
- For DESIGN.md and DESIGN.json, follow the format spec in
  impeccable's `reference/document.md`. Populate frontmatter
  (`colors`, `typography`, `rounded`, `spacing`, `components`) from
  the captured tokens. The `extensions` block of DESIGN.json carries
  v1's `componentStyle`, `motifs`, and `voice` arrays so nothing is
  lost.

Stardust does **not** invoke `$impeccable teach` or `$impeccable
document` for the current-state files: those commands write to project
root (the *target*) and run an interview. Stardust authors the
descriptive snapshot directly. The format spec from impeccable is the
contract; the runtime command is not.

The target-state PRODUCT.md and DESIGN.md at the project root are
written by `$stardust direct` in Phase 2 of the pipeline, not here.

### Phase 5 — Render `stardust/current/brand-review.html`

After Phase 4 writes the descriptive PRODUCT.md and DESIGN.md, emit
the current-state brand review per
`reference/brand-review-template.md`.

The brand-review HTML is the **first surface a human can eyeball** to
verify the extraction before committing to a redesign direction.
Misreads in the JSON (a wrong dominant radius, a missing system
component, a single-page palette bias) are obvious to the eye in five
seconds and invisible in JSON until someone notices. Putting the
review at the end of `extract` catches misreads while they are still
cheap to fix — re-extract is fast; re-direct + re-prototype is not.

The template is mandatory. In particular:

1. Run the **Tensions detectors** listed in
   `reference/brand-review-template.md` § Detectors. Each rule is
   mechanical; emit a tension card whenever the trigger condition
   matches. The review may ship with zero tensions if the data is
   too thin to evaluate, but the detectors must always be run.
2. Render in the brand's **own captured colors and fonts**, not a
   stardust shell.
3. Embed all CSS; do not load external JavaScript or fonts unless
   the live site already does.
4. Cite the source artifact for every section (e.g.
   `_brand-extraction.json § type` under Typography).

If the data for a section is missing, **omit the section** — do not
fabricate placeholders. The coverage callout at the top reflects what
is missing.

### Phase 6 — Update state and report

After all Phase 2-5 writes succeed:

1. Update `stardust/state.json` (schema in
   `skills/stardust/reference/state-machine.md`):
   - `site.originUrl`, `site.extractedAt`, `site.pageCap`,
     `site.totalDiscovered`, `site.crawled`
   - `pages[]` — one entry per crawled page with `status: "extracted"`,
     filled `currentStatePath`, empty `prototypePath` and `migratedPath`
   - `designSource` — only when `--design-source` was used:
     `{ url, capturedAt, path }` per § Cross-site brand sources
2. Print a one-screen summary:
   ```
   Extracted https://example.com (5/38 pages, sitemap.xml)

   stardust/current/
     PRODUCT.md            (register: brand, inferred from landing)
     DESIGN.md             (5 colors, 2 type families, 3 motifs)
     brand-review.html     (4 tensions surfaced)
     pages/                (5 files)
     assets/logo.svg       (extracted from inline SVG)
     _brand-extraction.json
     _crawl-log.json

   Per-page evidence:
     slug         live  waitMode               waitMs   status  media(img/bg)
     /            yes   medium                 2380     200     38/6
     /about       yes   medium                 2110     200     12/2
     /pricing     yes   medium                 1940     200     9/0   ⚠ low-media
     /products    yes   medium                 2640     200     21/4
     /contact     yes   domcontentloaded(fb)   8000     200     3/0

   Wait summary: 4 resolved at medium (avg 2.4s), 1 fallback (timed out at 8s)
     → /contact may be under-captured; consider --refresh
   Media summary: 1 page flagged low-media (/pricing) — see media-coverage check
   Vision check: 4 ok, 1 recaptured (/pricing) — _crawl-log.json#visionCheck

   Open stardust/current/brand-review.html to verify the extraction
   before running $stardust direct.

   Coverage note: extracted 5 of 38 discovered pages. The brand
   surface and brand-review use cross-page aggregation, so 5 pages
   covering distinct templates is usually sufficient. To extract
   more, re-run with --cap <N> (e.g. --cap 25) or list specific
   slugs with --pages.

   Next: $stardust direct  (resolve a redesign direction)
   ```

   The **per-page evidence table** is mandatory. The `live` column
   is `yes` when `_provenance.renderedBy === "playwright"` AND
   `waitMs > 0`, else `no`. A `no` row means the page record was
   not produced by a live Playwright render — this should never
   happen given the write-time guard, but the visible column is
   the defense-in-depth signal that catches the failure mode
   when it does (the 2026-04-30 lovesac synthesis bug went four
   phases deep before being caught because no report column
   surfaced the missing provenance). A maintainer scanning the
   summary should see `yes` on every row.

   Compute the wait summary by grouping each page's `_provenance.waitMode`
   and averaging `waitMs`. List slugs whose `waitMode` ends in
   `(fallback)` (rendered as `(fb)` in the table for width) as
   candidates for `--refresh`.

   The **`media(img/bg)` column** is the analogous defense-in-depth
   signal for imagery. It prints `<count of media.imgs> / <count of
   media.cssBackgrounds>`. Flag a row `⚠ low-media` when the page
   reads as brand/marketing (register `brand`, or a landing/solution/
   product template) yet has `cssBackgrounds: []` **and** few large
   rasters (no `media.imgs` entry with intrinsic width ≥ 600). That
   combination is the signature of a silently-failed background /
   lazy-media walk — `getComputedStyle(el).backgroundImage` read
   before the element was styled, a `::before`/`::after` host missed,
   or product imagery gated behind interaction the reveal pass did not
   trigger. The recipe already specs the full background walk
   (`playwright-recipe.md` § Capture list 11, hardened after the
   2026-05-04 ups.com dropped-hero failure), but a thorough spec that
   silently produces nothing still ships an image-less capture: the
   2026-06-26 knack.com run returned `cssBackgrounds: []` on every
   page and lost all product screenshots, hero art, and customer
   logos, and nothing surfaced it because no column reported media
   coverage. A flagged row is the cue to re-run that page with
   `--refresh` (and, if it persists, to fall back to headed Chrome per
   § Bot-management fallback). A maintainer scanning the summary should
   treat a `brand`-register site with all-zero `bg` counts as suspect,
   not as "this site uses no background images."

## Cross-site brand sources

Two flags widen extraction beyond the primary origin. Both are
opt-in; without them this section is inert.

### `--brand-source <url>` (repeatable) — sibling enrichment

An additional **same-brand** origin whose brand surface enriches the
primary extraction. Per source: shallow capture only — home page plus
up to 2 nav-linked pages, full recipe per page (Phase 2 rules apply,
provenance contract included). Captured records land under
`stardust/current/brand-sources/<host>/` (own `pages/` +
`assets/screenshots/`, same page-JSON shape); they are **evidence,
not inventory** — they never enter `state.json.pages[]`.

Their palette / type / motif / voice / photography evidence
**aggregates** into `_brand-extraction.json` with per-origin
provenance (`origins[]` per `reference/brand-surface.md` § Origins).
Two rules govern the merge:

- **Conflicts resolve toward the primary.** Where primary and
  brand-source evidence disagree for the same slot (a palette role,
  the heading family, the signature radius), the primary origin's
  value wins; the losing value is noted in `_provenance.notes`.
- **Brand-source evidence widens the surface.** A motif or
  photography treatment the primary site underuses enters as an
  *additional* entry, attributed in `origins[].contributedSignals[]`
  — so downstream `direct` / `uplift` can amplify a trait captured
  on a sibling property as **captured** evidence with an origin
  citation, never as invention.

Brand-source pages join palette/type/motif/voice aggregation but are
**excluded** from § System components, `voiceTable`, and cross-promo
detection — those describe the primary site's IA.

### `--design-source <url>` — design donor

Formalizes the proven canon.com pattern: a golden design source is
extracted separately and its design system becomes the fixed
**target**, while the primary origin supplies content.

- Capture the donor to `stardust/canon-source/` — same page-JSON and
  brand-extraction shapes as `stardust/current/`, rooted there (own
  `pages/`, `assets/`, `_brand-extraction.json`, `_crawl-log.json`).
  The default cap (5) applies unless the user widens it.
- Derive `stardust/canon-source/DESIGN.md` + `DESIGN.json` from the
  donor's brand surface — **descriptive**, same authoring rules as
  Phase 4.
- Stamp `state.json.designSource = { "url", "capturedAt", "path":
  "stardust/canon-source/" }`.

`stardust:direct` reads this stamp and pins the donor system as the
target: Mode A's brand-faithful pins transfer to the **donor**
surface while content stays with the primary origin — see
`skills/direct/SKILL.md` § Mode A. The donor records
`role: "design-source"` in its own
`canon-source/_brand-extraction.json#origins[]`; donor evidence never
aggregates into the primary `_brand-extraction.json`.

## Sibling-site discovery

After the primary crawl (Phases 2–2.5), harvest candidate same-brand
origins from evidence **already captured** — no extra navigation:

- footer / nav links out to other properties
- "our brands" / "our companies" pages
- `hreflang` alternates on other domains
- subdomain families (`shop.`, `careers.`, country subdomains)
- `og:site_name` matches across captured pages

List candidates with confidence + the evidence line in the crawl
report and in `_crawl-log.json#siblingCandidates[]`:

```json
{ "origin": "https://example.co.uk", "confidence": "high", "evidence": "hreflang alternate on 4/5 pages", "decision": "included" }
```

- **Interactive:** propose — *"found 3 candidate sibling properties —
  include as `--brand-source`?"* — and proceed on the answer.
- **Hands-off** (`state.json.handsOff` is true): auto-include up to
  **2 high-confidence** candidates as brand-sources; record the
  decision in `siblingCandidates[].decision`.

Discovery is capped and cheap: harvesting reads captured evidence
only, and each included sibling gets the shallow brand-source
capture (≤ 3 pages). It must never balloon the crawl.

## Concurrency

Page captures run **concurrently**: the Phase 2 queue is drained by
4–8 parallel browser contexts (`--concurrency`, default 4). Each
worker owns its `BrowserContext`; consent state is re-established per
context (Setup step 3). Media `resolves` / HEAD checks are batched
with `Promise.all`. Brand-surface aggregation (Phase 3) may proceed
incrementally as pages complete, so long as the written
`_brand-extraction.json` reflects every extracted page. The bundled
crawler implements the pool (`crawl.mjs --concurrency <n>`).

Across processes, per `state-machine.md`: stardust does not lock. Two
concurrent extracts on the same project are last-write-wins. Document
this in the user report; do not engineer around it.

## Failure modes

- **Network failure mid-crawl.** Continue, record in `_crawl-log.json`,
  end with a partial state. State.json reflects only successfully
  extracted pages. User can re-run; already-extracted pages are
  skipped unless `--refresh <slug>`.
- **HTTP 4xx/5xx, non-HTML content, soft-404s.** Validated explicitly
  per `reference/playwright-recipe.md` § Response validation. Each
  produces a distinct error class (`HTTPError`, `ContentTypeError`,
  `EmptyPageError`) recorded in `_crawl-log.json#crawl.failures[]`.
  Failed pages do **not** appear in `state.json` as `extracted` —
  they appear only in the failure log. Without this validation a 5xx
  page silently lands as an empty success and propagates wrong data
  to `direct` and `prototype`.
- **Login wall.** Do not attempt to authenticate. If the home page
  redirects to a login screen, capture that one page, mark the rest as
  unreachable, and ask the user how to proceed (provide cookies via
  Playwright config, change the entry URL, or scope to public pages).
- **Bot-management block (Akamai / Cloudflare / F5 / Imperva).**
  When the first navigation returns `ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR`,
  `ERR_QUIC_PROTOCOL_ERROR`, or hangs through the hard-cap on a
  TLS/H2 fingerprint check, the issue is JA3/H2 fingerprinting on
  bundled-chromium-default headless mode — not auth, not network.
  Switch to `headless: false, channel: 'chrome'` per
  `reference/playwright-recipe.md` § Bot-management fallback. Do
  **not** retry headless: it will fail identically. The headed
  fallback works against most enterprise / commerce origins;
  `playwright-extra` + stealth plugin is a non-standard escape
  hatch for the residual cases. The headed window pops visibly,
  which is acceptable for interactive runs and unacceptable for
  unattended pipelines — surface this to the user when first
  triggered.
- **JavaScript-only content.** Playwright already handles this. If
  the configured wait condition never fires within the mode's hard
  cap (`reference/playwright-recipe.md` § Wait modes), fall back to
  `domcontentloaded` and capture what is rendered. Record the
  fallback in the per-page `_provenance.waitMode` and surface in the
  wait-summary line of the final report.
- **Synthesis attempt (forbidden).** When the agent (or a delegated
  sub-agent) cannot run a real Playwright render for a page —
  whether due to time pressure, token budget, or a tool/network
  failure — the only correct outcome is to record the page as a
  Phase 2 failure (`errorClass: "ProvenanceMissing"` in
  `_crawl-log.json#crawl.failures[]`) and continue. **Synthesizing
  a page record from `_brand-extraction.json` plus URL patterns
  plus captured photos at "semantically matching" template
  positions is forbidden.** This was the 2026-04-30 lovesac.com
  failure — 20 of 25 pages synthesized this way and the cascade
  ran four phases on the synthesized data before the gap was
  caught by a meta-question. The synthesis shortcut produces
  output indistinguishable from a successful run and propagates
  fabricated content through every downstream phase.

## Prep mode (--prep)

When invoked with `--prep`, extract runs an extended pass that
prepares the inventory for migration. Discovery-mode runs (without
`--prep`) are unchanged: small cap, no typing, no module detection,
presales-friendly. `--prep` is the gesture that says "the user is
committing to migrate; build the data structure migrate consumes."

`--prep` adds five things on top of the standard procedure:

### 1. Lift the cap

`--prep` implies `--all`. Migration coverage requires the full
inventory — the small discovery cap (5 pages) is insufficient. The
cap-respecting selection logic from `reference/ia-extraction.md`
§ Page selection still applies for ordering and junk-filtering;
it just doesn't truncate.

#### Sub-agent prompt requirements (when delegating)

When `--prep` is heavy enough that the agent delegates extraction
to a sub-agent (a presales-shaped pattern when the inventory is
large), the sub-agent prompt **must**:

1. **Forbid synthesis by name.** The literal sentence
   *"do not synthesize a page record from `_brand-extraction.json`
   + URL patterns + captured photos; every page must be a live
   Playwright render"* must appear in the prompt. The earlier
   wording *"must actually invoke Playwright per page"* was
   satisfiable in spirit by synthesis-with-photo-reuse and
   produced the lovesac failure. Naming the shortcut explicitly
   closes that loophole.
2. **Require a per-page evidence table in the return.** Columns:
   `slug | waitMode | waitMs | fetchedAt | httpStatus`. The
   parent agent reads this table on completion and aborts if
   any row is missing or shows `waitMs: 0`.
3. **Require the wait-summary line in the return**, formatted
   identically to Phase 6's wait summary, so the parent can
   surface it in the user-facing report without reformatting.

These three are mandatory; missing any of them in the sub-agent
prompt is itself a recipe violation. The cascade-level guard in
`prepare-migration` validates the resulting per-page JSONs via
`validateProvenance()` regardless — but a well-formed sub-agent
return makes the failure cheaper to diagnose.

### 2. Page typing

For each extracted page, infer the `type` field from URL pattern
and content shape (LLM judgment). Catalog from
`skills/stardust/reference/state-machine.md` § Page types:
`landing | article | listing | program | form | static | unique`.

Write the inferred type to `state.json.pages[].type`. The user
confirms or refines during `direct --prep`. Discovery-mode runs
leave `type` as `null`.

### 3. Module candidate detection

After Phase 3 (brand-surface extraction), scan extracted pages for
**recurring structural patterns**. A pattern that appears in N+
pages with similar shape (same sequence of elements, same
`data-section` / `data-purpose`, similar text shape) is surfaced
as a module candidate.

#### Signal-source priority

Detection consumes per-page captured fields in this priority
order. Each higher signal is **weighted more heavily** in the
match-score; lower signals are tie-breakers and corroboration,
not primary evidence. The priority exists because higher-up
fields are explicitly extracted and structured (no parsing
ambiguity), while the bottom of the list (`landmarks[].innerText`
substring search) is fragile against capture variations and was
the source of the 2026-04-29 sliccy.com under-detection (0
hits for `pre-footer-shell`, 1 of 2 hits for `install-tile` —
both modules genuinely present on every page, both invisible
because the substrings being searched lived past the truncation
boundary that has since been removed).

1. **`pages/<slug>.json#headings[]`** — cross-page repeats of
   the same heading text in the same level. Highest signal:
   structured, explicit, captured in full regardless of body
   length.
2. **`pages/<slug>.json#ctas[]` labels** — cross-page repeats
   of the same CTA label appearing on similar surfaces.
3. **`pages/<slug>.json#media.cssBackgrounds[]` URLs** — same
   asset URL on multiple pages is a strong system-component
   signal (already specced as a system-component candidate in
   `reference/brand-surface.md` § Cross-page CSS-background
   reuse; module detection consumes the same signal at finer
   granularity).
4. **`pages/<slug>.json#forms[]` actions** — cross-page repeats
   of the same form `action` URL. Newsletter / contact / search
   forms are the typical hits.
5. **`pages/<slug>.json#components.componentsByLandmark`** when
   present (per future `current-state-schema.md` extension):
   per-landmark counts of cards / grids / etc.
6. **Substring search in `landmarks[].innerText`** — lowest
   signal. Use only as corroboration once a candidate has
   already passed the higher-signal checks; never as the
   primary detector.

A candidate that fires on signals 1 + 2 above the threshold is
high-confidence; a candidate that fires only on 6 should be
treated as speculative and surfaced as such for the user to
confirm in `direct --prep`.

Candidate output is a draft entry under
`DESIGN.json.extensions.modules[]`:

```json
{
  "id": "candidate-<short-hash>",
  "slots": [
    { "name": "<inferred>", "type": "text|link|image|...", "required": false }
  ],
  "instances": [
    { "slug": "home",   "selector": "..." },
    { "slug": "donate", "selector": "..." }
  ],
  "status": "candidate"
}
```

The `status: "candidate"` flag distinguishes draft entries from
confirmed modules. `direct --prep` is where the user names them
and promotes (or prunes).

### 4. Typed content slots

Per-page JSON (`current/pages/<slug>.json`) gains a `slots`
section that identifies content slots per page-type:

- `article` pages: `headline`, `deck`, `byline`, `meta`,
  `lead-image`, `body`, `pullquotes[]`, `related[]`
- `listing` pages: `index-headline`, `filter-controls`,
  `card-grid` with typed sub-slots per card
- `program` pages: `program-headline`, `summary`,
  `feature-grid`, `cta-band`
- `landing`, `form`, `static` — typed slots inferred per
  content shape

Schema additions live in `reference/current-state-schema.md`
§ Typed slots (extend that doc separately).

### 5. Prep summary

Replace Phase 6's standard report with the prep summary format:

```
extract --prep complete
=======================

Inventory:    127 pages crawled (5 prior, 122 new)
Provenance:   127/127 live (every page has Playwright evidence)
Page types:   landing 1 · article 84 · listing 6 · program 12 · form 3 · static 18 · unique 3
              (LLM-inferred; refine in direct --prep)

Module candidates: 8
  hotline-211         5 instances  (home, get-help, donate, news, programs)
  donate-band         12 instances (home, donate, news, all article footers)
  story-card          7 instances  (home, news, programs)
  ...

Typed slots:  filled per page-type (see current/pages/<slug>.json § slots)

Next: $stardust direct --prep  (confirm types, name modules)
```

The `Provenance: <live>/<total> live` line is mandatory in
prep-mode output. When the ratio is anything other than
`<total>/<total>` the prep run has failed the synthesis guard;
list the affected slugs as a sub-bullet and treat the prep run
as incomplete (the cascade-level guard in
`prepare-migration` SKILL.md surfaces the same check between
phases).

Default mode (no `--prep`) is unchanged. The flag is intended for
the `prepare-migration` orchestrator, though direct invocation is
supported.
