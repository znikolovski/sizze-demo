# Edge Delivery Services Operations - Code Sync

Deploy code changes from GitHub to Edge Delivery Services.

## API Reference

| Intent | Endpoint | Method | Required Role |
|--------|----------|--------|---------------|
| sync code (full) | `/code/{owner}/{repo}/{ref}/*` | POST | `develop` or `admin` (`code:write`) |
| sync file | `/code/{owner}/{repo}/{ref}/{path}` | POST | `develop` or `admin` (`code:write`) |
| delete code | `/code/{owner}/{repo}/{ref}/{path}` | DELETE | `develop` or `admin` (`code:delete`) |
| code status | `/code/{owner}/{repo}/{ref}/{path}` | GET | `basic_author`+ (`code:read`) |

**Note:** Code operations use `{owner}/{repo}` (GitHub), not `{org}/{site}` (content). If user gets 403 on code sync, they need the `develop` role.

## Operations

### Sync Full Repository

Use the `/*` wildcard to recursively sync the entire repository tree:

```bash
curl -s -X POST \
  -H "x-auth-token: ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  "https://admin.hlx.page/code/${CODE_OWNER}/${CODE_REPO}/${REF}/*"
```

**Success:** `Code synced for {owner}/{repo}. Changes now live on all sites using this repo.`

### Sync Specific File

```bash
curl -s -X POST \
  -H "x-auth-token: ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  "https://admin.hlx.page/code/${CODE_OWNER}/${CODE_REPO}/${REF}${PATH}"
```

**Success:** `Synced {path} to code bus.`

Example: Sync just the hero block:
```bash
curl -s -X POST \
  -H "x-auth-token: ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  "https://admin.hlx.page/code/${CODE_OWNER}/${CODE_REPO}/main/blocks/hero/hero.js"
```

### Code Status

```bash
curl -s \
  -H "x-auth-token: ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  "https://admin.hlx.page/code/${CODE_OWNER}/${CODE_REPO}/${REF}${PATH}"
```

### Delete Code

**DESTRUCTIVE OPERATION - CONFIRMATION REQUIRED**

Before executing, you MUST:
1. Tell user: "This will delete {path} from the code bus. In repoless setups, this affects ALL sites sharing the codebase."
2. Ask: "Do you want to proceed? (yes/no)"
3. Only execute if user confirms with "yes"

```bash
curl -s -X DELETE \
  -H "x-auth-token: ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  "https://admin.hlx.page/code/${CODE_OWNER}/${CODE_REPO}/${REF}${PATH}"
```

## Batch Code Update (Webhook-Only)

`POST /code/{owner}/{repo}/{ref}` (without a path) is a **webhook-oriented** endpoint used by GitHub integrations to process push events. It requires a `changes` array payload matching GitHub webhook format. This endpoint is called automatically — do **not** use it for manual code sync. Use the `/*` wildcard endpoint above instead.

---

## Repoless Warning

In a **repoless setup**, multiple sites share one code repository. Code sync affects ALL sites.

**Before syncing, check if repoless:**

```bash
ORG=$(cat .claude-plugin/project-config.json | node -e "
  const d = require('fs').readFileSync(0,'utf8');
  console.log(JSON.parse(d).org || '');
")
SITES_JSON=$(curl -s -H "x-auth-token: ${AUTH_TOKEN}" "https://admin.hlx.page/config/${ORG}/sites.json")
SITE_COUNT=$(echo "$SITES_JSON" | node -e "
  const d = require('fs').readFileSync(0,'utf8');
  try { console.log((JSON.parse(d).sites || []).length); } catch(e) { console.log(0); }
")

if [ "$SITE_COUNT" -gt 1 ]; then
  echo "REPOLESS: $SITE_COUNT sites share this codebase"
fi
```

**If repoless, warn user:**

> "This is a repoless setup with {N} sites sharing the same code. Code sync will affect ALL sites:
> - site-a
> - site-b
> - site-c
>
> Proceed with code sync?"

Only execute after confirmation.

## Natural Language Patterns

| User Says | Operation |
|-----------|-----------|
| "sync code" | Full repo sync |
| "deploy the latest code" | Full repo sync |
| "sync blocks/hero/hero.js" | Sync specific file |
| "deploy code changes" | Full repo sync |
| "update the code" | Full repo sync |
| "delete code blocks/old.js" | Delete code file |
