description: Convert per-page styled HTML prototypes (stardust under stardust/prototypes/**, or claude-design / Mobirise / Relume / Lovable / v0 / Figma-derived pages, or JSX prototypes pre-rendered to HTML, often under samples/) into Edge Delivery Services (EDS / AEM) blocks and content pages, then deploy via DA. Each prototype section becomes one EDS block; the prototype's per-section CSS becomes that block's CSS scoped under the block class. Use when the user wants to lift styled per-page HTML prototypes into a working EDS site under blocks/ and content/.

# stardust:deploy — prototypes → EDS/AEM

## When to use

The user has:
1. **Per-page styled HTML prototypes** — one file per page, each carrying its own CSS. Accept any of these shapes:
   - **Single-file with inline `<style>`** and `:root` tokens + semantic `<section class="…">` (e.g. stardust output, or claude-design "Stardust"/Mobirise/Relume-style pages). Easiest — convert directly.
   - **External per-page `.css`** (the `<style>` lives in a sibling stylesheet). Read the linked CSS the same way you'd read an inline `<style>`.
   - **`<x-dc>` document-content with everything inline-styled** (per-element `style="…"`). Harder — you must lift inline styles into a scoped block stylesheet.
   - **React/JSX prototypes** (an HTML shell that mounts `.jsx` components at runtime). **Pre-render to static HTML first** (run it, or screenshot + read the JSX to reconstruct the DOM); you cannot decorate a shell that has no server-rendered `<main>`.
   The prototypes typically live under `stardust/prototypes/**` or a `samples/<Name>/` folder — don't hard-code the path; discover them.
2. An EDS project at the repo root — `blocks/`, `styles/`, `scripts/`, `head.html`, plus existing blocks (`fragment`, `section-metadata`). If the project is **vanilla `aem-boilerplate`** rather than the AuthorKit runtime this skill assumes, run the **Runtime bootstrap** below first.
3. A goal to convert: prototypes → authorable EDS blocks + EDS content pages under `content/**`.

If the user has prototypes but no EDS scaffolding, stop and ask whether to bootstrap. If they have EDS but no prototypes, this skill doesn't apply.

## Runtime bootstrap (vanilla aem-boilerplate targets)

This skill's runtime is the **AuthorKit** runtime (`ak.js` page boot, `postlcp.js` static header/footer fragments, `body.session` font gating, `decorateSession()`). The conversion steps below assume those files exist. They are **NOT** in this skill folder — they live in the canonical AuthorKit repo (`github.com/aemsites/author-kit`). (The `sanitise.js` DA-write helper is bundled with this skill at `skills/deploy/scripts/sanitise.js`; it is not part of the ported runtime.)

If the target project is a **vanilla `aem-boilerplate`** (it has `scripts/aem.js` + `scripts/scripts.js` and `header`/`footer` blocks, but no `ak.js`/`postlcp.js`), port the runtime before Step 1.

**Automate it (#6):** run `node skills/deploy/scripts/bootstrap-authorkit.mjs --target . [--from-sibling <dir> | --ref <gitref>]`. The script does the entire port below — copies the PORT-IN set, removes the boilerplate set, applies AND verifies both mandatory edits (failing loud instead of the usual silent footer-error-box), patches the `body.appear` blank-render gate, and writes `.eslintignore`. Two source modes:
- **`--from-sibling <dir>` (preferred in a multi-site repo):** copy the runtime from another EDS project in the workspace that is already bootstrapped (has `scripts/ak.js` with both edits). Offline, deterministic, and parity-safe with a known-good *deployed* runtime — no re-fetch, no re-patch risk per site. This is the right default when several sites share one repo (e.g. 8 subfolder sites).
- **`--ref <gitref>`:** fetch a **pinned** author-kit ref tarball and port from it. Pin a real commit/tag (the script's `AUTHORKIT_REF` constant or `--ref`), **not** a tracking branch — author-kit's runtime has drifted (static-fragment → block-based header/footer), so an unpinned port can silently change what you get. If the fetched runtime no longer matches the static-fragment model the steps below describe (`loadStaticFragment`, `postlcp.js` injecting `fragments/{header,footer}.html` via `innerHTML`), pin an older known-good ref or use `--from-sibling`.

The manual manifest (what the script does, for reference / hand-porting). Fetch the author-kit tarball and copy:

**Port in (from author-kit):**
```
scripts/ak.js scripts/scripts.js scripts/postlcp.js scripts/lazy.js scripts/utils/*
tools/**                      # da/da.js (+ sidekick, quick-edit, scheduler — keep so lazy.js/scripts.js imports resolve). sanitise.js is bundled with this skill, not ported.
deps/**                       # rum.js + lit (head.html loads deps/rum.js)
head.html                     # AuthorKit head: loads ak.js + scripts.js + styles.css + deps/rum.js
blocks/fragment blocks/section-metadata
.hlxignore
```

**Remove (boilerplate the AuthorKit runtime replaces):**
```
scripts/aem.js scripts/delayed.js          # replaced by ak.js + lazy.js
blocks/header blocks/footer                 # replaced by static fragments/{header,footer}.html (Step 6)
blocks/cards blocks/columns blocks/widget   # unused demo blocks (delete to avoid stale aem.js imports)
styles/fonts.css styles/lazy-styles.css     # @font-face goes in styles.css; AuthorKit head loads only styles.css
```

**After porting, two runtime edits are mandatory (do BOTH — they're halves of one change):**
1. **`scripts/lazy.js` (#4):** the stock AuthorKit `lazy.js` lazy-loads `utils/footer.js`, which does `loadBlock(footer)` and collides with the static footer fragment (renders a visible "Error" box, since there is no `blocks/footer`). **Delete the `import('./utils/footer.js')…` line.**
2. **`scripts/postlcp.js` (#21):** deleting `utils/footer.js` also removed the only code that set the `<footer>`'s class. Without it, the fragment's own root selector (`footer.footer { background: … }`) never matches and any styling on the fragment ROOT (background/padding/color) silently no-ops. In `loadStaticFragment`, set the class before injecting:
   ```js
   const html = await resp.text();
   el.className = name;          // so header.header / footer.footer match
   el.innerHTML = html;
   ```
   This bug is invisible when the footer happens to match the body background; it bites the moment a fragment has its own background (e.g. a yellow footer).

When starting a NEW conversion in a repo where a sibling site is already bootstrapped, port from that sibling (`bootstrap-authorkit.mjs --from-sibling <dir>`) — it already carries both edits and matches a known-good deployed runtime. Otherwise port from a **pinned** author-kit ref, not a tracking branch (the runtime drifts).

**Lint mismatch (#6).** The AuthorKit runtime is authored for `@adobe/eslint-config-helix`; a boilerplate project lints with `airbnb-base`, so `npm run lint` will throw thousands of errors on the vendored runtime + minified `deps/`. Treat the runtime as vendored — add to `.eslintignore`:
```
deps/
scripts/ak.js
scripts/lazy.js
scripts/postlcp.js
scripts/scripts.js
scripts/utils/
tools/
blocks/fragment/
samples            # reference prototypes, not project code
```
Your generated blocks + `styles/styles.css` still lint clean under airbnb (expand any single-line multi-declaration CSS rules the prototype used). Alternatively, adopt the author-kit `eslint.config.js` (helix) wholesale.

## Playwright re-probe (run before anything that renders)

`--no-save` playwright installs from earlier phases are pruned by any later
real `npm i` — including this skill's own bootstrap adding a devDependency
(extract SKILL.md § Setup → `--no-save` installs are ephemeral). Before the
Local-QA harness, the computed-layout gate, or any probe below, verify
`node -e "import('playwright').then(()=>process.exit(0))"` from the project
root and re-install (`npm i -D playwright --no-save --legacy-peer-deps`) on
failure.

## Runtime-detection probe (run before Step 1 — write `stardust/runtime-contract.json`)

Two EDS runtimes look identical from the content side but need different generated code, and a wrong assumption here is **silent and sitewide**. Before converting anything, inspect the repo — `scripts/ak.js` vs `scripts/aem.js`, how `loadBlock` wraps blocks, what the button decorator emits — and record the answers:

```json
{
  "runtime": "authorkit | vanilla-eds",
  "blockWrapperClass": "none | block",
  "buttonClasses": ".btn / .btn-primary / .btn-group | .button / .button-container",
  "fragmentScriptPolicy": "inert-innerHTML | executed",
  "emptySectionCollapse": true
}
```

Block CSS/JS generation and the Local-QA harness read this contract instead of assuming a runtime. The two costliest wrong guesses:
- **`blockWrapperClass`** — AuthorKit's `loadBlock` (`ak.js`) only sets `data-block-name`; it **never adds a `.block` class** (blocks sit inside `.block-content` as `<div class="<name> <variant>">`). CSS must scope `.<name> …`, **never `.<name>.block`** — that selector silently never matches, grids fall back to `display: block`, and every grid section stacks single-column ("mobile layout on desktop") while typography still looks fine. Confirm by asserting a grid container computes `display: grid` in a headless render.
- **`buttonClasses`** — the AuthorKit decorator emits `a.btn` / `.btn-primary` / `.btn-secondary` inside `p.btn-group`, NOT the stock EDS `.button` / `.button-container`. Style the wrong family and every CTA ships as a bare unstyled link.

When `emptySectionCollapse` is true (the page-metadata block leaves an empty padded section after its content is consumed into `<head>`), add `main .section:empty { display: none }` to the foundation — or an empty ~88px band sits between the header and the first real section.

## Deploy (DA Source API, from a local agent)

**Steps 1–9 are the conversion methodology**; deploy is the one transport-specific step. From a local agent (Claude Code / CLI), each converted page deploys headlessly:

| Stage | How |
|---|---|
| Code | `git push` the branch → AEM Code Sync builds it |
| Sanitise | `skills/deploy/scripts/sanitise.js` — run it before the write (DA corrupts raw UTF-8) |
| Content write | DA Source API: `PUT admin.da.live/source/<org>/<repo>/<path>.html` (multipart, field name **`data`**, `type=text/html`) |
| Make live | `POST admin.hlx.page/preview/<org>/<repo>/<branch>/<path>` (then optionally `/live/...`) |
| Auth | IMS token (`DA_TOKEN`) — see the `da-content` / `da-auth` skills |

The content payload is a **body fragment** (see Step 9). The deploy needs the **code branch pushed to GitHub** so the branch preview (`<branch>--<repo>--<org>.aem.page`) renders with your blocks. See `da-deploy-protocol.md` for the full curl contract.

**For more than a few pages, use the bundled driver instead of a hand-rolled loop (#4).** `node skills/deploy/scripts/deploy-batch.mjs --org <org> --repo <repo> --branch <branch> --content content [--concurrency 4] [--no-publish]` runs `PUT → preview → live` across a content tree with bounded concurrency, a **persistent ledger** (`content/.deploy-ledger.json`) so a re-run **skips pages already live** and only re-drives FAILs, capped-backoff retries on `000/429/5xx`, an **append-only** log (survives a restart), and a delivered-`.plain.html` check before flipping a page to `live` (admin 200 ≠ delivered). It's idempotent — safe to Ctrl-C and re-run, which is the documented recovery for a transient-blip half-deploy. A serial hand-rolled bash loop that truncates its own log on restart is the anti-pattern this replaces.

**Per-page atomic delivery contract.** A page is `deployed` only when the full chain passes, in order: sanitise-wrapped file (`scripts/sanitise.js`) → `PUT` (multipart field `data`, `type=text/html`) → `POST /preview/` → `POST /live/` → **GET the rendered `.plain.html` and assert**: HTTP 200, the `<body>` wrapper intact, exactly one `<h1>`, zero `about:error`, no `/img/` srcs — plus, when key facts are declared for the site (#86 — `DESIGN.json.extensions.metadata.keyFacts[]`, written by `direct`; skip the gate and note the skip when the field is absent), grep the RAW full-page HTML (not the rendered DOM) for each fact string on the pages that carry them. Only then flip the page's ledger entry to `deployed` — never on the POST codes (admin 200 ≠ delivered).

**A `.plain.html` pass is NOT a layout pass — add one computed-style assertion (#the silent-failure guard).** The text-level asserts above are all satisfied while the page renders as a single stacked column, because the AuthorKit `.<name>.block` scoping bug (see `blockWrapperClass` in the runtime contract) makes every grid fall back to `display: block` *with the typography still correct*. This shipped green on a real e2e site. So the contract's final gate is a **headless computed-style check on the delivered live URL** (not `.plain.html`): load the page in a headless browser and assert, for the first page of each template, that every block whose CSS declares a grid/flex layout **computes `display: grid`/`flex` (not `block`)**, `main .section` count > 0, blocks are decorated (`data-block-name` present), zero `pageerror`, zero broken images. A block that should grid but computes `block` fails the page — do not flip it to `deployed`. This is the assertion `blockWrapperClass` in the runtime contract calls for; the atomic contract is where it must actually run, once per template. Two field-decodes worth pinning: a **burst of `PUT` 400s is a malformed path, not rate limiting** — lowercase every segment, never a double slash (`content//…` 400s the PUT while preview/live still 200), no trailing `-`/`_` on a segment; and **write long loops to a bash script file with absolute binary paths** (`/usr/bin/curl`, the full `node` path) — zsh drops PATH inside `while`/`for` in some contexts, and the resulting `command not found` burst mimics a transport failure.

**Token hygiene (#16).** The IMS token typically lives in repo `.env` as `DA_TOKEN`. Before the first commit, make sure `.gitignore` excludes `.env`, `.env.*`, and `qa/` (the local QA harness) **on the branch you'll branch tests from** — otherwise every test subbranch re-exposes the token. Keep `samples/` out of commits too. Dev tokens last ~24h; a `401` with an empty body means expired → refresh and retry (the write is idempotent).

**DA_TOKEN lifecycle — preflight and re-check, never fail pages on it.** At setup, preflight the token: decode the JWT `exp` claim when present (base64-decode the middle segment) and smoke-test ONE authenticated DA call before any batch. **Re-check before each long batch** — a token fresh at setup can expire mid-run. On a `401` mid-batch: checkpoint the ledger (the batch driver's persistent ledger already records per-page state), stop the batch, and halt with a single actionable instruction — "DA_TOKEN expired; refresh it in `.env` and re-run the same command (the ledger skips delivered pages)" — instead of letting every remaining page fail red. Token expiry is the one credential failure the agent cannot self-recover; it is a legitimate hard stop even in a hands-off run.

## The one rule that drives everything else

**One prototype `<section>` = one EDS block — as the SAFE DEFAULT.** Don't abstract speculatively, and don't extract "patterns" across prototypes unless sections are genuinely the same pattern. This default exists because each section's bespoke CSS can't be wrongly shared; violating it casually cost full resets (see ANTI-PATTERNS).

**The one deliberate exception — collapse SAME-PATTERN sections into one block + VARIANT classes.** When two or more sections are the same content pattern (card grids, prose/CTA bands, quotes, accordions) differing only in skin, emit ONE canonical block (`cards`, `text`, `quote`, `accordion`) and put each section's look behind a variant class (`class="cards brands"`), brand styling in the variant CSS. The block JS stays generic (classify cells by content); only the CSS differs per variant. This is the David's-Model library win (small, reusable, variant-driven — not 20 bespoke names) and is proven to preserve fidelity. Keep genuinely-unique sections (a hero, a countdown widget) bespoke. Budget for it: variant CSS is careful work and some grids are count-specific.

The prototype is the visual spec. The block exists to AUTHOR its content — see **The ENCODE contract** below for what well-authored content looks like, and ANTI-PATTERNS for how a block must defensively PARSE it.

## Output you will produce

For a typical 5–10 page site:

- **One block per distinct prototype section.** A 5-page site with 6 sections each → ~12–18 blocks (some are reused across pages, e.g. `closing`).
- **One EDS content page per prototype page.** Same number of pages.
- **Nav + footer fragments** at `content/fragments/{nav,footer}.html` (the navigation lives in `nav.html`, not `header.html`).
- **Updated `styles/styles.css`** with brand tokens lifted from the prototype's `:root`, a reset, the EDS section scaffold, and a global button system (see "Lean on EDS button conventions" below). Nothing more.
- **No shared utility modules.** No wave systems. No section-metadata style classes. No motion library. The prototype already encodes these per-section; keep them inside the owning block.

## The ENCODE contract — what well-authored content looks like

The ANTI-PATTERNS below are the **decode** side: a block must parse robustly whatever DA hands it. This is the **encode** side: what the content page should EMIT in the first place. One principle drives all of it:

> **Decoration that must survive DA rides a semantic inline tag — never a class, never an invented delimiter.** DA strips `<span>` and author classes from block cells, but PRESERVES `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<code>`, `<a>`, `<picture>`/`<img>`.

- **Accent / emphasis → `<em>`, never `<span class="em">`** — DA strips the span and the accent is silently lost. Ensure the block CSS targets BOTH `em` and `.em`.
- **Key facts must live in SERVER-RENDERED content, never solely in chrome fragments (#86).** The static header/footer fragments are client-injected (`postlcp.js` `innerHTML` after first paint), so anything that exists only there — a trust fact line ("Open source · Apache 2.0 · built by X"), pricing, contact facts — is INVISIBLE to non-rendering crawlers and AI bots on every page. If a fact matters for SEO/LLM answerability, author it in page content (a fact panel, an install-section sentence, the metadata description); the fragment copy is presentation, not the crawlable source of truth. Verify by grepping the RAW served HTML (no JS) for the key-facts list — the rendered DOM check passes either way and hides the failure.
- **Sub-fields → a leading preserved tag, never an in-band delimiter.** Don't invent `Step|Title`, `flag :: desc`, `name|tag` micro-syntax (authors must learn it). Lead the cell with the field's tag — kicker → `<strong>`, code/flag/path → `<code>` — and the block reads the leading tag as the term, the rest as the value. (A block MAY still parse a delimiter as a back-compat fallback — that's decode, not what you emit.)
- **No raw presentational HTML in content.** No `<sup>` (move unit superscript into the block — split `185+` into number + generated `<sup>`); don't use `<br>` for layout (a deliberate editorial line break via Shift+Enter is fine — it's not "exposed code").
- **Grouped item sets → one row per item.** A band of N similar units (metrics, stats, feature cards) is ONE row per unit, its parts as flat siblings in that cell — not one cell per atom (loses which label pairs with which number) and not all-in-one-cell. The block segments per row.
- **Lists / FAQ → rows, not nested lists or one blob.** An accordion/FAQ is a head cell then one row per Q/A (question cell + answer cell). David's-Model #5.
- **Section head → DEFAULT CONTENT, not a block row.** The eyebrow/heading/lede that sits *above* a repeating block (cards, metrics, FAQ, insights) is prose, not part of the block's structure — author it as **default content** in the section, before the block, so DA and `.plain.html` keep it out of the block table (David's #1). The block **reabsorbs** it at decorate time (see "Section heads" below), so this is a pure markup/authoring win with **zero pixel change**. (NOT for a genuine widget whose rows ARE its structure, e.g. countdown.)
- **Buttons → one emphasis axis:** primary `<strong><a>`, secondary `<em><a>`; never `<strong><em><a>`. (See "Lean on EDS button conventions".)
- **Headings → real outline, no level jumps:** one `<h1>`; section titles `<h2>`; card/sub titles `<h3>` (never skip to `<h4>`). Canonicalising a prototype's card `<h4>` to `<h3>` is correct.
- **Metadata stays name/value** (config only — David's #14); never name/value for semantic content.

### Section heads: default content the block reabsorbs (zero pixel change)

A head-bearing block (one with a section eyebrow/heading/lede above repeating units) should NOT carry that head as block rows. Author the head as **default content** in the section, before the block; the block table holds only the repeating units. Then the block **reabsorbs** the head so the decorated DOM — and every pixel — is identical to the old in-table form:

- On `decorate(block)`, read the section's leading default-content wrapper, build the SAME `.section-head` the block used to build from its first rows, and **remove the wrapper**. Result: identical decorated DOM; CSS untouched.
- **The head wrapper is a sibling of the block's SECTION-LEVEL wrapper, not of the block, and its class varies by runtime.** Use `block.closest('.block-content')?.previousElementSibling` and match BOTH `.default-content` (AuthorKit runtime) **and** `.default-content-wrapper` (vanilla EDS). `block.previousElementSibling` alone is `null` (the block is nested in `.block-content`).
- Keep the old in-table head (leading non-unit rows) as a **back-compat fallback**.
- **Verify zero change:** diff the *decorated* block `outerHTML` (ids/`media_<hash>` normalised) old-vs-new — it must be byte-identical, with 0 default-content wrappers left after decorate.

A FOUC is possible (head paints as default content, then reabsorbs); the final layout is identical — watch CLS only if default-content margins differ markedly from the head's.

### Images: editorial → authored content, decorative → CSS only

**Any raster/brand image that carries meaning is EDITORIAL and must be authorable content** — including hero / feature / CTA-band backgrounds that sit *behind* text and a scrim (the author swaps them per campaign; they're the page's most important visual). For editorial images:

1. Upload the binary to DA: `PUT https://admin.da.live/source/{org}/{repo}/media/<scope>/<file>` (multipart, field name **`data`**, correct `Content-Type`; upload the JPG/PNG/webp source only — the pipeline generates responsive variants).
2. Author a single `<img src="https://content.da.live/{org}/{repo}/media/<scope>/<file>" alt="…">` in the cell (branch-independent; the pipeline emits the responsive `<picture>`). **Never** a repo-relative `/img/…` in content (→ `<img src="about:error">`). **Never** bake imagery into block JS by index (`CARD_IMAGES`/`LOGOS`) — that isn't authorable.
3. The block renders the authored `<img>` into a background LAYER (`.hero-bg` / `.card-media` / `.text-media`); the scrim/gradient is a CSS `::before` OVER it. Keep a fixed CSS asset as the no-image fallback.

**Decorative = CSS only** applies to image-LESS treatments (gradients, scrims, textures, solid washes) and to genuinely fixed brand assets referenced as **CSS backgrounds** root-relative (`/img/<brand>/…` — browser-fetched, never ingested, so no `about:error` and no upload).

**The check that catches the #1 mistake:** after preview, grep the delivered `.plain.html` for the expected `<img>`+alt count. "It renders" hides CSS-background images — they're absent from `.plain.html`, carry no alt, and are neither authorable nor AI/SEO-visible.

**When the image src is a SOURCE/external URL (migration), verify it resolves BEFORE you author it.** Re-using an image straight off the source page is the most common way to ship `<img src="about:error">`: the preview ingester fetches the authored URL, and if that fetch fails the delivered image is `about:error` — silent, since the page still renders. So verify every authored `<img>` whose src points at the source/CDN — **but the verification fetch must match how extract reached the origin, and a failure is not automatically "omit".**

**Verify with the recorded fetch technique, not a bare curl (#2 — bot-managed origins).** A large fraction of real migration targets sit behind Akamai / Cloudflare / Imperva / F5, which 403 a plain `curl` (and headless requests) while serving the same asset fine to a real browser. A blanket "curl it; if not 200, omit" therefore **strips every real brand image** off an entire bot-walled site — the exact failure the quality bar forbids. Instead: read `_crawl-log.json#discovery.fetchTechnique`. When it is `headed-chrome`, verify image URLs with an **in-page fetch from the open browser context** (`page.evaluate(async u => (await fetch(u)).status, url)`) — that inherits the JA3/H2 fingerprint and cookies (per `extract/reference/playwright-recipe.md` § Bot-management → Sub-resource fetches); a bare `curl`/`request` will falsely report the asset broken. Only when `fetchTechnique` is plain may a bare `curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' <url>` stand in.

**Distinguish 403-bot-wall from 404-missing, and prefer rehost over omit.** A `403`/`401` from a CDN means *blocked-when-hotlinked*, NOT *missing* — and even if the URL would 200 to the ingester now, hotlinking the source CDN from the delivery host is fragile (it can 403 cross-origin at preview time, yielding `about:error`). So the default remediation for a `403`/blocked captured image is **download-and-rehost**, not omit: extract already saved a local copy under `stardust/current/assets/media/` via the in-page fetch — upload it to DA (`PUT …/source/{org}/{repo}/media/<scope>/<file>`) and author the `content.da.live` URL (see Images, above). **Omit only on a true `404` (asset genuinely gone) after attempting the rendition/delimiter repairs below** — and never substitute a generic logo/placeholder (`…-logo…`) as if it were editorial. Two real failure signatures where the asset exists — fix the URL, don't drop it: (1) **wrong rendition variant** — the page exposes only a derivative that 404s while a sibling resolves (e.g. a portrait's `…/4x3/768/…` 404 vs `…/original/768/…` 200) → rewrite to the resolver; (2) **missing query delimiter** — `…/<id>&wid=600&hei=…` with no `?` makes `<id>&wid=…` a bogus id → 403 → repair the first `&` after the id to `?`.

**`content.da.live` media URLs are auth-gated — don't anon-curl them.** Once you've rehosted to DA, the recommended `https://content.da.live/{org}/{repo}/media/…` src returns **`401` to an anonymous `curl`** even though it is correct and the preview pipeline ingests it fine. Do not treat that `401` as "broken" and omit. The correct verification for an already-rehosted/DA-hosted image is **post-preview**: grep the delivered `.plain.html` for `about:error` (must be 0) and assert the expected `<img>`/alt count — see `da-deploy-protocol.md` step 3b. Exempt `content.da.live` (and `admin.da.live`) URLs from the pre-author 200-check entirely.

## Steps

### 1. Audit (light)

**First, normalize the input to static HTML.** If a prototype is React/JSX (an HTML shell that mounts `.jsx` into `#root`), **pre-render it to static HTML** before auditing (#24). The reliable recipe:
```bash
# 1. serve the prototype's OWN folder with a plain static server (NOT file:// —
#    babel-standalone XHRs the .jsx and file:// CORS-blocks it; the aem dev
#    server CSP-blocks the inline scripts too).
( cd samples/<proto> && python3 -m http.server 8765 & )
# 2. load in Playwright (React/babel load from unpkg — needs internet), wait for
#    mount, capture #root's innerHTML, save it for the block agents to read:
#    page.goto('http://localhost:8765/<file>.html'); waitForTimeout(4000);
#    fs.writeFileSync('samples/<proto>/_rendered.html', root.innerHTML)
```
From there it converts like an external-CSS prototype (semantic classes + the prototype's `.css`). If it's `<x-dc>` document-content, the sections are still `<section>`/`<div>` elements; just expect inline `style="…"` instead of a `<style>` block. The rest of this skill assumes a static `<main>` exists.

**View behind routing / sign-in (#27).** If the view you want is not the default render (e.g. a signed-in dashboard behind a sign-on flow), **seed the app's persisted state before it boots** rather than capturing the landing page. Many prototypes persist their route to `localStorage`: `page.addInitScript(() => localStorage.setItem('<key>', JSON.stringify({page:'dashboard', user:'Alex'})))` then navigate. Generic alternatives: drive the UI to the view (fill + submit the sign-on form, then capture) or set the router hash/URL. Capture `#root` for the view you actually intend to convert.

Read every prototype's `<main>` markup (skip the `<style>` for now) and produce a per-page section list:

```
home: hero, work, approach, team, clients, closing
approach: approach-hero, manifesto, tenets-detailed, cadence, closing
team: team-hero, team-roster, work-style, recent, careers, closing
…
```

A useful pattern: dispatch the `Explore` subagent at thoroughness=quick with this exact ask. You don't need a 22-pattern punch list — you need filenames + section names. **Resist the urge to "find shared patterns."** Pattern reuse will emerge organically when two sections turn out to be byte-identical.

**Fingerprint per-instance variation BEFORE writing block code (#90).** A section-name list is
copy-level; it does NOT reveal that instances *inside* a repeated group look different — an active
filter chip vs its outline siblings, a filled accent CTA among outline CTAs, image cards vs
image-less title-cards. Those are the details a copy-driven conversion silently flattens (a whole
grid of identical cards, one CTA styled like the rest), and the mandatory gates (one `<h1>`, grids
compute `grid`) still pass. So run the proactive probe up front:
`node skills/deploy/scripts/style-fingerprint.mjs "file://<abs>/<proto>.html"`. For every group of
sibling instances it clusters each instance by a COMBINED signature — computed **style-delta**
(`background/border/color/background-image/weight/align`) AND **structural** (`hasImg`, `hasSvg`,
child count) — and reports any group with >1 cluster as a **candidate** per-instance variation for
the owning block to reproduce. It is advisory: it will also flag legitimate variation (a footer with
one bold link among plain ones), so filter false positives with judgment — but never flatten a real
variant (an active chip, an accent CTA, an image-less card) just because the block treats siblings uniformly.
The structural half is load-bearing: image-vs-image-less cards (and any `:has()`/`:not()`-driven
variant) share the same top-level computed style, so a style-only probe misses them — include the
structural signals. The manifest becomes the block author's checklist; this is the pre-block
complement to Step 10's post-deploy `content-diff` (which catches the same class of miss too late).

### 2. Decide names + reuse — LOCK BEFORE WRITING ANY CODE

Naming rules:
- Block name = the prototype's `<section class="X">` value, kebab-cased (`hero`, `work`, `closing`, `approach`).
- **Never name a block after a reserved EDS class** (#15). `section`, `default-content`, `block-content`, `wrap`, and `button` are used by the runtime's section/decoration DOM — a block named `section` collides with `<div class="section">` and breaks decoration. When the prototype's section class is generic/reserved (Festool uses `class="section"` twice), derive a semantic name from the section's `data-screen-label` / intent instead (`new-products`, `discover`) and carry any modifier like `tinted` as a block variant.
- When the same section appears on multiple pages with identical visual treatment, build ONE block and use it everywhere. The classic example: `closing` CTA at the end of every page.
- When a section appears on multiple pages but looks different (e.g. home `hero` vs case-study `case-hero` vs service `service-hero`), they are different blocks. Prefix with the page archetype.
- When two sections within one prototype share the same visual treatment but different copy (e.g. case-study `discovery` and `decisions` are both 2-col prose with eyebrow + headline), it is fine to merge into one block (`case-prose-2col`) with a single text variant cell ("tinted" / "default"). Use your judgment.

**Scale the naming ceremony to the number of pages.** For a **single-page** conversion where each `<section class="X">` has a self-evident, unique name (`hero`, `quick`, `used`, `stats`…), there are no cross-page reuse decisions to make — just lock `block name = section class` and proceed; don't pepper the user with questions. The questions below matter for **multi-page** sites, where the same-looking section recurs and you must decide reuse vs. archetype-prefixing.

**Surface 3–5 naming questions to the user before writing any block code (multi-page sites):**
- "What's the home hero called? `hero`?"
- "Are the closing CTAs across all pages identical? Same `closing` block?"
- "Should case-study discovery/decisions/solutions be one block or three?"
- "Is the per-service hero distinct from the home hero? Build `service-hero` separately?"

Lock the answers in writing (in `stardust/eds-conversion-log.md` or similar). This is the single highest-leverage step in the whole process.

### 2b. Section schema + decode tier — close the round-trip BEFORE writing code (#93, #95)

The dropped-CTA / role-swap / flattened-variant class has ONE root cause: the authored rows (ENCODE) and the block's `decorate()` (DECODE) are written independently and hoped to be inverses. Two moves close the loop up front; the in-loop `block-roundtrip` gate (#94, Step 8) then proves it closed.

**Emit the section schema — the shared ENCODE/DECODE contract (#93).** Once names are locked, generate the per-section contract both sides are written FROM:

```bash
node skills/deploy/scripts/section-schema.mjs "http://localhost:8791/<prototype>.html" \
  --out stardust/eds-schema/<page>.json
```

Per section it emits the ordered role-classified inventory (heading / eyebrow / cta+href / body — the SAME classifier `content-diff` and `block-roundtrip` measure with, from `skills/diff/scripts/content-inventory.mjs`) and the repeating-unit groups (count + per-unit composition: headings/ctas/imgs/textRuns, uniform or not). Use it on both sides:

- **ENCODE**: one row per repeat unit, fields in schema order; every schema item appears in the authored content. An item you deliberately drop is a decision recorded in the conversion log — never an accident.
- **DECODE**: the block's JSDoc cites its section's schema path; `decorate()` classifies exactly the roles the schema lists, and the schema's unit count is the post-decorate count assertion (#48/#52).

Cross-check `repeats[].uniform` against the #90 fingerprint: `uniform: false` means a per-instance variant (active chip, accent CTA, image-less card) the block must reproduce, not flatten.

**Pick the decode tier per section — template-slotted vs reconstructive (#95).** Reconstruction is where decode bugs live, so only reconstruct where authors need the structural freedom:

- **Template-slotted (fidelity by construction).** For fixed-composition sections whose structure never changes at authoring time (a bespoke hero, a cinematic band, a stat/countdown composition): `decorate()` holds the prototype section's inner DOM verbatim as a template literal and SLOTS the authored values into it by role — eyebrow text into the template's eyebrow node, heading into the `<h1>`, each CTA's text+href, the authored `<picture>` into the media slot. The decorated DOM ships byte-equal to the prototype, so the segmentation-bug class (#48/#52/#56/#76) cannot occur. Editors still own every line of copy — the content page is unchanged and server-rendered (this is NOT client-injected chrome; #86 doesn't bite). Structure edits need a developer: the right trade for sections whose structure nobody edits.
- **Reconstructive (authorable structure).** For repeating/data sections where authors add/remove units (cards, FAQs, listings, menus): classify + segment defensively per #48/#50/#52 — and let the schema + round-trip gate carry the burden of proof.

Record the tier per block in the conversion log. Default: template-slotted for bespoke one-offs, reconstructive for repeat groups.

### 3. Foundation

Update `styles/styles.css` to the following — and ONLY the following:

- Lift `:root` tokens verbatim from the prototype's `<style>` (colors, fonts, type scale, weights, tracking, layout, motion easing).
- Document reset (box-sizing, margin reset, scroll-behavior, body font + bg, ::selection, img defaults, button reset). **The `img` reset MUST be `img { display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto; }` (#36).** EDS's media pipeline emits `<img>` with `width`/`height` attributes; without `height: auto` a width constraint stretches the image vertically (a landscape 1920×1258 rendered 677×1258). The bug is invisible on the prototype (raw `<img>`, no attrs) — it only appears post-pipeline.
- A minimal EDS section scaffold:
  ```css
  main .section { display: block; }
  main .section > .default-content,
  main .section > .block-content { display: block; }
  main > div, .has-template, div[data-status] { display: none; }
  ```
- A global button system (see next section). This is the one place per-block CSS does NOT own its paint — buttons are site-wide and convention-driven.
- **Reserve the static header's height — or the late fragment injection shifts the first section → CLS (#81).** `postlcp.js` injects `fragments/header.html` AFTER first paint (it's a deferred fetch). In the common layout where the header sits in flow ABOVE the first section (full-bleed hero *below* the nav), the hero therefore renders at `y=0`, then jumps DOWN by the header's height the instant the fragment lands — a large layout shift the browser attributes to the hero block (a real page measured **CLS 0.143, ~0.13 of it the hero**; metric-matched fonts do NOT fix it because the cause is the header box appearing, not a font swap). Reserve the header's rendered height on the **bare `<header>` element** in `styles/styles.css` (it applies before the fragment loads — `decorateHeader()` sets the class early, but styling the bare element covers the pre-class sliver too), with responsive `min-height` matching the fragment per breakpoint and the chrome's own `background` so any reserve-vs-actual delta is invisible:
  ```css
  header { min-height: 98px; background: var(--brand-ground); }   /* desktop nav+banner height */
  @media (width <= 767px) { header { min-height: 102px; } }
  @media (width <= 480px) { header { min-height: 120px; } }       /* banner wraps to 2 lines */
  ```
  Make the header's height **deterministic** so the reserved value actually matches: keep the reservation breakpoints in sync with the fragment's, and avoid nav-link *wrap zones* (e.g. extend the burger/hamburger breakpoint so the inline links can't wrap to a second row at awkward widths). Reserve slightly OVER the natural height (a few px) so you never under-reserve and shift — on a dark/uniform ground the small gap is invisible; a `header:empty` page (`header: off`) removes the element so the reservation is moot. **The footer needs NO reservation** — it's below the fold, so its late injection shifts nothing above it. Verify with a CLS probe (Playwright `PerformanceObserver({type:'layout-shift'})`) that **delays the woff2/fragment fetches** to reproduce the slow-network swap PSI measures — a fast localhost load hides the shift.

That's it. No section-style classes. No motion primitives. No utility classes beyond the button system.

`scripts/scripts.js` stays minimal — only the page boot. No reveal-on-scroll. No marquee init. No header scroll-state. Per-block animation is owned by per-block CSS.

**Token-completeness gate — every `var(--x)` a block references MUST be defined in `:root` (#91).**
Lifting a section's CSS into a block routinely drags in a token the block author never added to the
foundation (`var(--navy-700)` in a gradient, `var(--accent-2)` in a hover). A referenced-but-undefined
custom property **silently invalidates the WHOLE declaration** — `background: linear-gradient(var(--navy) 0%, var(--navy-700) 100%)`
with `--navy-700` undefined drops the entire background and the element falls back (a navy card renders
light), with no error and no lint flag. Gate it mechanically after the foundation and before deploy:
```bash
comm -23 <(grep -rhoE 'var\(--[a-z0-9-]+\)' blocks/**/*.css | sed 's/var(//;s/)//' | sort -u) \
        <(grep -oE '\--[a-z0-9-]+' styles/styles.css | sort -u)   # MUST be empty
```
Any line printed is a token a block uses that `:root` doesn't define — add it to the foundation `:root`.

### 4. Self-host fonts and minimize CLS — never put font loads in `head.html`

Four principles, applied in this order on every project:

**0. Ship an `@font-face` for EVERY named family — not just the body face (#65).** Prototypes name a display face AND a body face (`--display: "Hebden Incised", …; --body: "Lekton", …`). If you self-host only the body font, every heading/numeral/title whose stack names the un-shipped display family silently falls back to `Times New Roman`/`Arial` (generic serif/sans) — **invisible to size/color checks** (the glyphs differ but the metrics match; only the `FONT MISMATCH` probe flag #66 or an eyeball catches it). Distinct from #11/#22 (wrong weight) and #30 (opsz): here the family is NAMED but NEVER SHIPPED. For each quoted family in `--display`/`--body`/any heading stack, self-host a matching `@font-face` (download + commit the woff2 under `styles/fonts/`, reference root-relative — never the prototype's brand-CDN origin, #44). **Checklist:** grep every quoted family in `styles.css`'s font stacks against the `@font-face { font-family }` names declared — any unmatched name is a silent fallback.

Then four principles, applied in this order on every project:

**1. Leave `head.html` untouched. No font lines, period.**
No Google Fonts `<link>`. No CDN `<link rel="stylesheet">` for type. No `<style>` blocks declaring `@font-face`. **No `<link rel="preload" as="font">`** either — even self-hosted preloads belong out of `head.html`. The browser will fetch the woff2 it needs as soon as `styles/styles.css` parses; the `body { arial }` / `body.session { var(--font-body) }` split (principle 3) eliminates the CLS that preloading is normally meant to prevent. **All `@font-face` declarations live in `styles/styles.css`.**

**2. Self-host EVERY brand face — including proprietary ones — and emit a licensing alert (#80).**
Inspect the prototype to identify each font family and its license:
- SIL OFL 1.1 (Inter, JetBrains Mono, Fraunces, Roboto, Open Sans, IBM Plex, Source Sans, etc.) → self-host. License permits redistribution, including embedding on the served domain.
- Apache 2.0 (some Google Fonts) → self-host.
- **Proprietary commercial (Pangram Pangram, Adobe Fonts / Typekit, Monotype, foundry-direct) → self-host anyway for fidelity, BUT raise a LICENSING ALERT (#80).** The DEFAULT is brand-faithful: a converted/presales page that silently degrades the brand display face to Arial reads as broken to the client (this is exactly what a stakeholder notices first). So lift the prototype's actual webfonts — if the prototype ships `.otf`/`.ttf` (claude-design/stardust prototypes usually do, under `assets/fonts/`), convert them to latin `woff2` with `fontTools` (`f.flavor='woff2'; f.save(...)`, ~30–60 KB each) and declare them in `styles/styles.css` exactly like an OFL face. Because they're proprietary you MUST surface the licensing obligation in THREE places so it can't ship unnoticed:
  1. a banner comment at the top of `styles/styles.css` (`⚠️ FONT LICENSING REQUIRED BEFORE GOING LIVE` + foundry per family + "do not publish to `aem.live` until the webfont/embedding license is confirmed");
  2. a `styles/fonts/LICENSING.md` file (table: file → family → foundry → status, plus the remove-and-fall-back instructions);
  3. the conversion log, AND your hand-off message to the user.
  Document the **remove path**: if licensing can't be confirmed, delete the `.woff2` + their `@font-face` rules and the stacks fall back to the metric-matched system fallback (principle 3/4). This is the inverse of the old "keep CDN / accept Arial" guidance — prefer fidelity + a loud alert over a silent generic fallback. (Only keep a CDN load when the prototype itself loads from an Adobe/Typekit CDN AND you cannot obtain the font files — then document the CDN coupling + CLS cost.)

For OFL fonts, fetch latin-subset variable woff2 files. The fastest reliable source is jsDelivr's `@fontsource-variable/<name>` packages:

```bash
mkdir -p styles/fonts
curl -sSL -o styles/fonts/<name>-variable.woff2 \
  "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@fontsource-variable/<name>@latest/files/<name>-latin-wght-normal.woff2"
# italic, if used:
curl -sSL -o styles/fonts/<name>-italic-variable.woff2 \
  "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@fontsource-variable/<name>@latest/files/<name>-latin-wght-italic.woff2"
```

Latin-only variable woff2 is typically 30–60 KB per file, weights 100–900 included.

**Match the axes the prototype loads — incl. optical size (#30).** Check the prototype's Google Fonts `<link>` URL. If it requests an **`opsz`** (optical-size) axis — e.g. `Source+Serif+4:opsz,wght@8..60,400;…` — the default `@fontsource-variable/<name>` file (`<name>-latin-wght-normal.woff2`) is **wght-only** (one fixed optical master) and headings will render subtly off (heavier/different letterforms at large sizes). Fetch the **opsz** file instead (carries both `wght` + `opsz`, ~2× the bytes); `font-optical-sizing: auto` (the CSS default) then tracks the size:
```bash
curl -sSL -o styles/fonts/<name>-opsz.woff2 \
  "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@fontsource-variable/<name>@latest/files/<name>-latin-opsz-normal.woff2"
```
More generally: self-host the variant whose axes match what the prototype loaded (wght-only vs opsz; italic if used).

**Non-variable fonts (#11).** Many Google fonts ship only as named static weights — no variable axis (e.g. **Barlow**, Barlow Condensed, Anton). For these, `@fontsource-variable/<name>` does NOT exist; use the **static** `@fontsource/<name>` package and fetch each weight you actually use:
```bash
curl -sSL -o styles/fonts/<name>-700.woff2 \
  "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@fontsource/<name>@latest/files/<name>-latin-700-normal.woff2"
```
Static `@fontsource` packages also do **not** publish a "Fallback" `@font-face`, so you must **compute** the metric-override values yourself (principle 3) from the woff2 with fonttools:
```python
from fontTools.ttLib import TTFont
f = TTFont("styles/fonts/<name>-400.woff2"); upm=f['head'].unitsPerEm; hhea=f['hhea']; os2=f['OS/2']
arial = dict(upm=2048, xavg=904)  # Arial reference (use Times metrics for a serif brand)
size_adjust = (os2.xAvgCharWidth/upm) / (arial['xavg']/arial['upm'])
adj = upm*size_adjust
print(f"size-adjust:{size_adjust*100:.2f}% ascent-override:{hhea.ascent/adj*100:.2f}% "
      f"descent-override:{abs(hhea.descent)/adj*100:.2f}% line-gap-override:{hhea.lineGap/adj*100:.2f}%")
```
Apply those to the system-font override `@font-face` (renamed `"Arial"` / `"Times New Roman"`) exactly as in principle 3.

**3. Body.session pattern with a metric-matched fallback `@font-face`.**
The brand font must NOT render at first paint. Default to a metric-matched system font; switch to the brand font once `decorateSession()` (in `scripts/ak.js`) adds `body.session`. The recipe:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: "<Brand>";
  src: url("/styles/fonts/<brand>-variable.woff2") format("woff2");
  font-weight: 100 900;
  font-display: swap;
}

/* Override the system font's metrics so it renders with the brand font's
   line box. Naming the @font-face after the system font (e.g. "Arial",
   "Times New Roman") makes any reference to that family in a font stack
   pick up the metric-adjusted version site-wide — no per-block changes. */
@font-face {
  font-family: "Arial";          /* "Times New Roman" for a serif brand */
  src: local("Arial");           /* local("Times New Roman") for serif */
  size-adjust: <X>%;
  ascent-override: <Y>%;
  descent-override: <Z>%;
  line-gap-override: 0%;
}

:root {
  --font-body: "<Brand>", arial, sans-serif;       /* serif: times, "Times New Roman", serif */
}

body { font-family: arial, sans-serif; }
body.session { font-family: var(--font-body); }
```

**Keep `body` VISIBLE — never gate display on `body.appear` (#40).** The font gate is the `body` → `body.session` font swap above; `ak.js` adds `body.session`. Do NOT port the aem-boilerplate pattern `body { display: none } body.appear { display: block }` into the foundation: the static-chrome runtime never adds `appear`, so every OFF-pipeline render (the Local-QA harness, the `visual-diff` probe) stays permanently hidden/zero-height — and a blank page silently passes most checks. (The probe now emits a `BLANK RENDER` red flag as a backstop, but the foundation must not introduce the gate in the first place.)

The metric-override values come from the `@fontsource-variable/<name>` package's published calibration — fetch their CSS:

```bash
curl -s "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@fontsource-variable/<name>@latest/index.css" \
  | grep -A 6 "Fallback"
```

Each fontsource package publishes a `<Name> Fallback` `@font-face` with `size-adjust`, `ascent-override`, and `descent-override` values. Lift those three numbers verbatim and apply them to a local-system `@font-face` renamed to the system font (`"Arial"`, `"Times New Roman"`, `"Courier New"`).

The CLS chain that results:
- **Initial paint**: `body { font-family: arial, sans-serif; }` — renders the metric-adjusted local Arial because the override `@font-face` named `"Arial"` wins over the OS Arial. Line box already matches the brand font's metrics.
- **Session activates**: `body.session` switches to `var(--font-body)`. Brand woff2 is still loading; Arial renders in its place with matching metrics. **Zero shift.**
- **Brand font loads**: swaps in. **Zero shift** because metrics already match.

**4. Match the fallback family to the brand font's classification.**
Use the SAME class of typeface for the fallback so visual rhythm is preserved during the load:
- Sans-serif brand → fallback `arial, sans-serif`. Override `@font-face "Arial"` with `local("Arial")`.
- Serif brand → fallback `times, "Times New Roman", serif`. Override `@font-face "Times New Roman"` with `local("Times New Roman")`.
- Monospace brand → fallback `"Courier New", courier, monospace`. Override `@font-face "Courier New"` with `local("Courier New")`. (Note: skipping monospace metric-matching is acceptable when the mono font is only used in small eyebrows/labels — CLS impact is negligible. Document the choice in the conversion log.)

Never substitute classifications (don't match a serif brand to Arial; don't match a sans brand to Times). Even with metric overrides, character widths and rhythm differ enough that the visible shift is jarring.

**Classification includes WIDTH — a condensed/narrow display face needs a condensed fallback, never plain Arial (#80).** "Sans→Arial" is only right for a *normal-width* sans. A narrow/condensed display face (PP Formula Narrow, Bebas Neue, Oswald, Barlow/Archivo Condensed, Anton) falling back to plain Arial is a width-class mismatch: Arial runs **~15–20% wider** with different letterforms, so headings lose the condensed character and wrap differently — a silent divergence the eye catches even when sizes/weights/tracking match exactly (a CardValet pass shipped PP Formula→Arial; the width probe showed Arial 975 vs PP Formula 839 for the same H1 string). When the condensed brand face is self-hosted (principle 2, now the default) this only bites if the webfont is blocked, but the fallback must STILL preserve width: put a condensed system/free face ahead of `arial` in the stack — `"<Brand>", "Arial Narrow", arial, sans-serif` (system `Arial Narrow` is present on macOS/Windows but NOT Android/Linux, so for guaranteed coverage self-host a free OFL condensed analog — Oswald / Barlow Semi Condensed / Archivo Narrow). Same logic for an *extended/wide* brand face. Quick check during foundation: for every `--*-font-family` token whose first face is condensed, confirm the final non-`sans-serif` fallback is also condensed.

**Self-host the prototype's INTENDED fallback, not its accidental system render — and verify with a width probe, never `document.fonts.check` (#77).** Prototypes routinely load **zero `@font-face`** and name a proprietary brand font first (`--display: "Bellfort", "Bebas Neue", system-ui`). On any machine missing the brand font the prototype silently renders **system-ui** — so its on-screen display face is an *accident of the viewing machine*, not the design intent. Do NOT match that accident (don't set EDS `--display` to system-ui because "that's what the proto shows"). The prototype's OWN stack documents the intent: self-host the first **redistributable** fallback (OFL/Apache — e.g. Bebas Neue) so EDS ships the condensed display face the design wants; keep proprietary families documented in the conversion log. **Verify what actually rendered with a width probe** — `document.fonts.check('24px "X"')` returns **true for any family name the page references**, installed or not, so it produces false "fonts match" reads. Instead measure: a span at `font-family:"X",monospace` whose width equals a known-absent name's width means X fell back (absent); a distinct width means X is really rendering. (A beermaker pass set `--display` to Bebas Neue via a `fonts.check` false-positive — the width probe later showed the proto actually renders system-ui, but Bebas Neue was still correct as the documented intended fallback.)

**Multiple display families (#12).** A brand may use several families — e.g. Barlow (body) + Barlow Condensed + Barlow Semi Condensed (display). The `body.session` pattern only gates the **body** family; display families referenced directly by class (headings, eyebrows) load with `font-display: swap` and aren't fully CLS-eliminated. Define each as a `:root` token (`--font-cond`, `--font-semi`) and reference it per-block on the elements that use it. Fully metric-matching every display family is optional polish — for display text used sparingly (eyebrows, big condensed headings) the CLS impact is small; **document the trade-off** in the conversion log rather than over-engineering it. **But when a display family is used in an ABOVE-THE-FOLD heading (the hero `<h1>`, an LCP title), metric-match it too** — compute its `size-adjust`/`ascent-override`/`descent-override` from the woff2 (the same fonttools recipe as #11) and put a dedicated fallback `@font-face` SECOND in that family's stack: `--hero: "Lilita One", "Lilita One Fallback", …`. The fallback family MUST have its own name — do NOT reuse the renamed `"Arial"` face the body match already defines (#11), since that carries the *body* font's metrics, not the display font's. (Note: in practice the dominant first-section CLS is usually the late header box, #81, not the display-font swap — fix the header reservation first, then metric-match above-fold display faces to zero the remainder.)

**Match the prototype's effective weight (#22).** A single-weight display font (e.g. **Anton**, ships only 400) often appears *bolder* in the prototype than its one weight: a bare `<h1>`/`<h2>` inherits the browser-default heading weight (700), and the browser **faux-bolds** the 400-only face. If your foundation sets `h1,h2,h3 { font-weight: 400 }`, headings render visibly lighter than the prototype. Set the weight the prototype actually shows (often 700) so the faux-bold matches — don't assume "one weight in the file ⇒ `font-weight: 400`".

### 5. Lean on EDS button conventions — DO NOT manufacture button anchors in block JS

The EDS link decorator in `scripts/ak.js` (`decorateButton()`) automatically applies button classes when authors wrap a link in inline emphasis. This runs during page boot, AFTER block JS. Block JS just needs to clone the cell anchor as-is.

**Author markup → auto-applied class:**

| Author markup | Class applied | Visual |
|---|---|---|
| `<strong><a>` | `.btn.btn-primary` | wavelength fill, dark text |
| `<em><a>` | `.btn.btn-secondary` | transparent + outline (color-aware) |
| `<em><strong><a>` | `.btn.btn-accent` | canvas fill on dark surfaces |
| `<del><a>` | `.btn.btn-negative` | rare; destructive |
| `+ <u>` inside any | adds `.btn-outline` | transparent variant |
| 2+ buttons in same parent | parent gets `.btn-group` | flex with gap |

**Add to `styles/styles.css`** (the project's brand button system):

```css
a.btn {
  display: inline-flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 10px;
  padding: 16px 26px;
  font-size: 12px;
  font-weight: var(--weight-bold);
  letter-spacing: 0.08em;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  border: 1px solid transparent;
  transition: background 0.25s var(--ease-out), color 0.25s var(--ease-out), border-color 0.25s var(--ease-out);
}

a.btn-primary { background: var(--color-wavelength); color: var(--color-ink-rich); border-color: var(--color-wavelength); }
a.btn-primary:hover { background: var(--color-canvas); border-color: var(--color-canvas); }

a.btn-secondary { background: transparent; color: currentcolor; border-color: rgb(255 255 255 / 40%); }
a.btn-secondary:hover { border-color: currentcolor; background: rgb(255 255 255 / 5%); }

/* On light surfaces, secondary uses dark-tinted outline. List the dark sections explicitly. */
main .section:not(.dark, .closing, .hero, .team) a.btn-secondary { border-color: var(--color-rule-strong); color: var(--color-ink-rich); }
main .section:not(.dark, .closing, .hero, .team) a.btn-secondary:hover { border-color: var(--color-ink-rich); }

/* Trailing arrow on primary/accent. */
a.btn-primary::after, a.btn-accent::after { content: "→"; font-weight: 600; transition: transform 0.3s var(--ease-out); }
a.btn-primary:hover::after, a.btn-accent:hover::after { transform: translateX(4px); }

.btn-group { display: inline-flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 16px; align-items: center; }
```

**Surface-aware variants: scope to the BLOCK class, not just the section (#41).** When a button/link/text treatment differs on dark vs light surfaces, the prototype's dark-surface cue (e.g. `.hero`, `.cta-dark`) becomes a **block class** after conversion — a `<div class="hero">` nested inside the `<div class="section">`. So an override written as `main .section.hero a.btn-secondary` never matches (the `.hero` is one level below `.section`), and the on-dark CTA silently renders dark-on-dark. Scope on-dark overrides to BOTH: `main .section.dark a.btn-secondary, main .hero a.btn-secondary { … }`. QA any block on a dark background for secondary/ghost-CTA contrast (light outline + light text) — the button "exists" in metrics, so only contrast/eyeball catches this.

**Block JS pattern — just clone the cell:**

```js
// Get the cell that holds the CTAs
const ctaCell = rows[N]?.firstElementChild;
if (ctaCell && ctaCell.querySelector('a')) {
  const actions = document.createElement('div');
  actions.className = 'actions';
  [...ctaCell.childNodes].forEach((n) => actions.append(n.cloneNode(true)));
  container.append(actions);
}
```

DO NOT manufacture anchors with `cta.className = 'btn-loud'` or inject custom SVG arrows. The global `::after` arrow + the convention's class system handle 95% of cases.

**Block CSS pattern — only override what's actually different:**

The `closing` block's CTA is slightly larger than the global default. That's a legitimate override:

```css
.closing .actions a.btn-primary { padding: 22px 32px; font-size: 13px; }
```

Three lines. Targets the global class, not a custom one. This is the entire "blocks slightly augment defaults" pattern.

**When NOT to use the convention:**

Some links are NOT buttons. Examples:
- A wavelength-underlined text link in a section footer ("How we work →"). It's a styled text link, not a chip.
- Whole-card anchors on tile grids (`<a class="tile">…</a>`). The whole tile is the click target.
- Channel values in a closing CTA (`<a href="tel:…">801-363-0101</a>`). It's a value, not a CTA.
- `mailto:` / `tel:` links inside prose.

For these: the author leaves the `<a>` as a plain anchor in content (no `<strong>` / `<em>` wrap), and the owning block styles it with per-block CSS. The convention is for buttons; if it's not a button, don't apply it.

**Multi-variant button systems (#25).** The strong/em convention only names three slots (primary / secondary / accent). When a prototype has **more** context-specific variants than that — e.g. JFK's `.btn--accent` (yellow), `.btn--primary` (blue), `.btn--ghost` (outline), `.btn--onblue` (white-on-blue) — author emphasis can't express them. Don't force it: **lift the prototype's full `.btn` + variant system into `styles/styles.css`**, author the CTAs as plain `<a>` in content, and have each block apply the right `btn btn--<variant>` class to the cloned anchor (the block knows its section's variant). This is the same "if it doesn't fit, style it" escape hatch, applied at the button-system level rather than per-link.

### 6. Static header + footer fragments

Header and footer are **static fragments** — extracted verbatim from the prototype with their full DOM and styles intact. No EDS authoring, no block JS parsing. They are stored in `fragments/header.html` and `fragments/footer.html` at the repo root and committed to GitHub as code.

**Fragment file format:**

```html
<style>
  /* Scoped styles lifted from the prototype's _tokens.css and page <style> */
  .utility { background: var(--color-ink); ... }
  nav.topnav { position: sticky; ... }
  .nav-inner { ... }
  /* Include responsive breakpoints */
  @media (max-width: 900px) { ... }
</style>
<!-- Full prototype DOM, copied verbatim -->
<div class="utility">...</div>
<nav class="topnav">...</nav>
```

No `<!DOCTYPE>`, no `<html>`, no `<body>` wrapper. Just the raw `<style>` + DOM. The EDS runtime injects it directly into the page's `<header>` or `<footer>` element via `innerHTML`.

**Extraction rules:**

1. Copy the header DOM (utility bar + topnav) from any prototype — it's shared across all pages.
2. Copy the footer DOM from any prototype — also shared.
3. For each fragment, collect the relevant CSS rules from the prototype's `_tokens.css` and any page `<style>` blocks. Include all responsive breakpoints.
3b. **Lift the chrome element's OWN box styles (#31)** — `margin`, `padding`, `border` set on the prototype's `<header>`/`<footer>` element itself — onto `header.header` / `footer.footer`, not just the inner content styles. The fragment injects into the EDS `<header>`/`<footer>`, which sit OUTSIDE `<main>`, so the gap between the last section and the footer comes entirely from the footer's own top margin (e.g. `footer { margin-top: 72px }`). Easy to miss: the inner content looks right while the footer sits flush against the last block.
4. Scope the CSS inside a `<style>` tag at the top of the fragment file.
5. Rewrite relative asset paths (e.g. `../assets/logo.png`) to fully-qualified URLs on the code origin: `https://main--<repo>--<owner>.aem.page/path/to/asset`.
6. Rewrite relative link hrefs (e.g. `donate.html`) to root-relative paths (e.g. `/donate`) matching how EDS serves pages.

**Loading mechanism:** `scripts/postlcp.js` fetches `fragments/header.html` and `fragments/footer.html` from the code origin (`codeBase`) and injects via `innerHTML`. On branch-hosted pages (`<branch>--repo--org.aem.live`), relative paths resolve to the correct branch automatically.

**Fragments cannot run JavaScript.** Because the fragment is injected via `innerHTML`, any `<script>` inside it is inert — the prototype's header JS (mobile-menu toggle, scroll-state shadow, dropdown logic) will NOT run. Re-implement interactive chrome as **CSS-only**:
- **Mobile menu / drawer** → checkbox-hack: a visually-hidden `<input type="checkbox" id="mnav-toggle">` as the first element, `<label for="mnav-toggle">` for the open button and the close button and a full-screen scrim label, and CSS `#mnav-toggle:checked ~ #mnav { … }` to drive the open/close state and the panel transform.
- **Scroll-state shadow / sticky color change** → drop it (keep a static border), or use a CSS scroll-driven approach where supported. Don't try to reattach JS to the fragment.
- **Forms / inline `on*` handlers (#20)** → EDS's delivered CSP is `script-src 'nonce-…' 'strict-dynamic' 'unsafe-inline'`; with `strict-dynamic`, `'unsafe-inline'` is **ignored**, so inline `onsubmit`/`onclick` never fire. A real `<form>` would then submit and reload the page. Render such controls **non-submitting**: a `<div>` wrapper (no `<form>`) with `<button type="button">`. (Same root cause as the no-`<script>` rule — fragments are inert.)
- Document anything you dropped in the conversion log.

**Footer reconciliation (see #4).** The AuthorKit `lazy.js` also tries to load the footer as a *block* (`utils/footer.js` → `loadBlock(footer)`), which collides with the static footer fragment and renders an error box. Make sure the Runtime-bootstrap edit removing that import has been applied.

**Fragment root class (#26).** `postlcp.js` sets the host element's class to `header` / `footer`. If the prototype's chrome styling is keyed to a *different* root class (e.g. JFK's `.utilnav` / `.site-footer`), wrap the fragment content in a `<div class="<that-class>">` so the lifted root selector matches — `header.header` / `footer.footer` is only the host. (Don't nest another `<header>`/`<footer>` inside the host element; use a `<div>`.)

**`header: off` / `footer: off`:** To suppress header/footer on a specific page, add a metadata block with `header: off` or `footer: off`. The loader checks `getMetadata('header')` / `getMetadata('footer')` before fetching.

### 7. Blocks (parallel agents)

Dispatch one agent per page-archetype cluster (utility pages, services, case studies, etc.). Each agent owns a non-overlapping set of new blocks and content pages. Three to four parallel agents is the sweet spot.

The brief template:

> Per the project's locked direction: each prototype `<section>` becomes its own EDS block. Lift the prototype's `<style>` for that section verbatim, scope it under the block class (`.block-name .x` instead of `section.x .y`), and rebuild the prototype's DOM through a `decorate(block)` function that consumes EDS table-block input.
>
> **You own**: prototypes [list], content pages [list], sections [list].
>
> **Existing blocks — REUSE, do not recreate**: [list with one-line authoring shape per block].
>
> **Brand tokens** are global in `styles/styles.css`; do not redefine.
>
> **Round-trip contract (#93/#94)**: the page's authored rows AND your block's decode are both written from `stardust/eds-schema/<page>.json` (roles + repeat units — Step 2b); cite the schema path in the block JSDoc. After writing each block, run `node skills/deploy/scripts/block-roundtrip.mjs "<protoURL>" content/<page>.html --blocks <name>` — the block is NOT done until it exits 0 (0 structural 🔴).
>
> **Section layout — reproduce the prototype's max-width container (#13)**: if the prototype section wraps its content in a centered max-width container (`<div class="wrap">` / `.container` / `.inner`), your block MUST recreate it — build the content into a `.wrap` div (`block.replaceChildren(wrap)`), so the colored/section background bleeds full-width but the **content** stays within the page max-width. Only render content edge-to-edge where the prototype section itself is full-bleed (no inner wrapper). Getting this wrong is invisible at ≤1440px and only shows at wide viewports.
>
> **Images — `<image-slot>` placeholders (#2)**: claude-design prototypes use `<image-slot>` custom elements as image drop-targets; there are usually NO real image assets. Treat each image as an **optional** authored cell holding a `<picture>`/`<img>` (`const pic = cell.querySelector('picture, img'); if (pic) …`). When the cell is empty, fall back to the prototype's background treatment (e.g. dark `--ink`, or a placeholder rectangle) via the block CSS so the section still looks right with no image. Leave image cells EMPTY in the authoring snippet.
>
> **Scroll-reveal / JS-hidden content (#14)**: if the prototype hides content behind a class an inline `<script>` toggles on scroll (`.reveal { opacity:0 }` + an IntersectionObserver that adds `.in`), do NOT lift the `opacity:0` — the prototype script does not run in EDS, so the content would be **permanently invisible**. Render it visible; drop the reveal (keep only hover/`:hover` transitions). Honor `prefers-reduced-motion`.
>
> **Interactive / component-driven sections (#17)**: when a section is driven by a component (state, a list loop like `<sc-for>`, conditionals like `<sc-if>`, `{{ }}` bindings, a `data-count` counter, a tab/selector), split it: **data → authorable rows** (one row per list item, with the item's fields as cells) and **behavior → block JS**. Unlike static *fragments*, **block JS runs** — so `decorate()` is the right place to wire click handlers, an IntersectionObserver count-up, tab switching, etc. Render the default/active state in markup; drive the rest from JS-held local state. `{{ }}`/`<sc-for>`/`<sc-if>` are NOT EDS syntax — read them as "loop these rows" / "show one state".
>
> **Buttons**: do NOT manufacture button anchors. Author CTAs as `<strong><a>` (primary) or `<em><a>` (secondary) in the content page; in block JS, clone the cell's child nodes into a `.actions` wrapper. Block CSS only overrides global button styles when something is genuinely different (e.g. larger size). Text links with flourish (wavelength underline) are NOT buttons — leave as plain `<a>` and style per-block.
>
> **EDS block convention**: each block at `blocks/<name>/<name>.{js,css}`. JS exports `default async function decorate(block)`. Block input is `<div class="block-name"><div>row<div>cell</div></div>…</div>`. CSS scoped under `.block-name`. Inline SVG markup per-block (no shared utility). Honor `prefers-reduced-motion`.
>
> **EDS content page format**: NO `<head>` element (project `head.html` is injected by EDS), empty `<header></header>`/`<footer></footer>`, each top-level `<div>` inside `<main>` is one section containing one block, no `<style>`/`<script>`/section-metadata, fully-qualified image URLs.
>
> **Done criteria**: [list of paths]. Return a list of new blocks + one-line summary per page.

Agents do not need to coordinate on shared blocks — the brief tells them which existing blocks to reuse.

### 8. Block JS scaffold

```js
/**
 * <block-name> — <one-line description from prototype data-intent attribute>
 *
 * Authoring rows (positional):
 *   1. <picture> background image
 *   2. eyebrow text
 *   3. headline — render as a REAL heading element, never a bare <div>: the
 *      hero/lead block's headline becomes the page's single <h1>; every other
 *      section title becomes <h2> (sub-items <h3>). (use <strong> for emphasis)
 *   4. body paragraph
 *   5. CTA links — wrap primary in <strong>, secondary in <em>; the EDS link
 *      decorator applies .btn.btn-primary / .btn.btn-secondary
 *   6..N: card rows — cells: num | label | description
 */

function text(cell) { return cell ? cell.textContent.trim() : ''; }
function pic(cell)  { return cell ? cell.querySelector('picture, img') : null; }

export default async function decorate(block) {
  const rows = [...block.children];
  if (!rows.length) return;

  // 1. Read content by QUERYING, not by hard row index, for lead/hero blocks (#42):
  //    const h = block.querySelector('h1, h2');           // the heading
  //    const ps = [...block.querySelectorAll('p')];
  //    const lede = ps.find((p) => !p.querySelector('a')); // first link-free <p>
  //    const ctaP = ps.find((p) => p.querySelector('a'));  // link-bearing <p>
  //    const pic = block.querySelector('picture, img');
  // 2. Build the prototype's DOM (with prototype-style class names)
  // 3. For CTA rows, clone the cell's child nodes into a .actions wrapper —
  //    do NOT manufacture button anchors with custom classes.
  // 4. block.replaceChildren(...newMarkup);
}
```

**Prove each block's round-trip IN THE LOOP — per block, before deploy (#94).** Step 10's `content-diff` is the post-deploy proof; it must not be where defects are FOUND. After writing a block (and its authored rows), run the harness round-trip:

```bash
node skills/deploy/scripts/block-roundtrip.mjs \
  "http://localhost:8791/<prototype>.html" content/<page>.html --blocks <name>   # omit --blocks for all
```

It decorates the authored content locally with the block's own JS+CSS (the render-harness technique — no DA, no dev server), extracts the role inventory from the decorated section AND the matching prototype section with the SAME classifier as `content-diff` (`skills/diff/scripts/content-inventory.mjs`), and diffs them. Pass `--map <name>=<selector>` when the prototype section class differs from the block name; `--styles`/`--blocks-dir` when the repo layout isn't `eds/`- or root-level. Exit 2 on any structural 🔴 (MISSING CTA/HEADING/EYEBROW, ROLE SWAP) **or any decorate error** — fix the decode (or the authored rows) and re-run; the block is done when it exits 0. Font forks are deliberately NOT checked here (the harness renders local fonts; faces are Step 4 + Step 10's business). A `decorate errors` line means the block threw mid-run or its JS never installed (the harness INLINES block JS, so a module-scope `import` cannot resolve — inline the helper, or verify that one block via the dev-server harness + Step 10); either way the raw rows can false-match the prototype, so these fail the gate on their own. Template-slotted blocks (#95) still run the gate: it catches slot-fill mistakes and authored-row drift.

**Copy set for the playwright ESM rule:** when copying these gates into the project (extract SKILL.md § Setup — bundled scripts must run from the project so `import 'playwright'` resolves), copy **both** `skills/deploy/scripts/` **and** `skills/diff/scripts/` preserving the directory layout — `section-schema.mjs` and `block-roundtrip.mjs` import `../../diff/scripts/{diff-profiles,content-inventory}.mjs`.

**Lead/hero blocks: query content, don't hard-index rows (#42).** A hero that reads `rows[3]=headline, rows[4]=lede, rows[5]=CTA` breaks the moment the content shape differs — and the mandatory-metadata / single-`<h1>` SEO rework (#34/#35) actively **consolidates** the headline + lede + CTAs into ONE cell, so the fixed indices come back `undefined` and the hero `.wrap` (the LCP element and the only `<h1>`) renders EMPTY with no error. Decorate lead blocks by querying (`block.querySelector('h1,h2')`; link-bearing `<p>` = CTAs; `picture` from anywhere) so they tolerate BOTH the rich multi-row shape and the consolidated single-cell shape. **Disambiguate eyebrow vs lede by ORDER/length, not "first `<p>`" (#51):** both are link-free `<p>`s, so "first link-free paragraph = lede" swaps them (the short eyebrow comes first). The canonical lead order is **eyebrow → heading → lede**: the eyebrow is the short/uppercase line *before* the heading; the lede is the sentence-length `<p>` *after* it. Local-QA check: after decoration, assert the hero's inner wrap is non-empty and contains the `<h1>`.

**When cloning a cell into your OWN heading element, UNWRAP the cell's heading first (#55).** If you build a live `<h1>` and clone a source cell's *childNodes* into it, and that cell wraps its text in its own `<h1>` (which #35/#42 actively encourage), you get `<h1><h1>…</h1></h1>` — a duplicate heading and a doubled font cascade. Always `const inner = cell.querySelector('h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6') || cell;` then clone `inner.childNodes`. Local-QA: exactly one `<h1>`, and 0 descendant headings inside the live headline.

**Marker injection must be IDEMPOTENT (#70).** When `decorate()` PREPENDS a fixed decorative marker to authored heading/link text (a glyph `▶`, a badge, a `CH NN` number), first STRIP a matching leading occurrence from the cloned text node — `firstText.textContent = firstText.textContent.replace(/^\s*▶\s*/, '')` — because the author (or the #34/#35 SEO content rebuild) may already type it, so the marker doubles (`▶ ▶ Latest signal`). Apply the SAME strip at EVERY place the block injects that marker (section titles AND card links), not just some. (The visual-diff text-match catches a doubled glyph `X X …`.)

**Carousel slide segmentation is HEADING-boundary driven and ORDER-AGNOSTIC (#69).** Segment slides ONLY on the heading boundary — one heading opens one slide (a leading `<picture>` before the first heading may open slide 0). Fold EVERYTHING between two headings into the open slide regardless of authored order (eyebrow/label may come AFTER the heading, not before): first non-link text run = eyebrow, links = CTAs, extra text = description. Never let a post-heading text node open a NEW slide (that steals the heading slot and the CTAs never attach — symptom: N+2 jumbled slides with 0 CTAs). Local-QA: rendered slide count == authored heading count AND each slide's CTA count == authored.

**Split/photo-overlay segmentation: BUFFER the eyebrow that PRECEDES its heading (#76).** Heading-boundary segmentation (#52/#69/#73) opens a new group ON the heading — but in split panels and photo-overlay halves the eyebrow is the small label ABOVE the title, so it arrives BEFORE the heading and a "start collecting after the heading" loop drops it entirely. Worse, the body line after the heading then falls into the now-empty eyebrow slot (inheriting its accent/uppercase paint) and the next group's eyebrow bleeds into the prior group's teaser. Fix: keep a `pendingEyebrow` — any text seen before a heading is buffered and attached to the group that heading opens; once a group already has its body/CTA, further bare text re-buffers as the NEXT group's pending eyebrow (not this group's teaser). This complements #69 (carousel eyebrow may come AFTER the heading): don't hard-assume either order — buffer pre-heading text, classify post-heading text by what's already filled. The content is all in the DOM, so a count check passes while the render is scrambled — Local-QA: assert each group's eyebrow/heading/body/CTA land in their OWN slots (eyebrow text ≠ body text), not just that N groups exist. Hit on beermaker `the-people`.

**Carousel/rotator lead: exactly ONE server `<h1>` across all slides (#57).** A rotating hero authors N slide headlines; if each is an `<h1>`, the delivered HTML has N `<h1>`s (the block may rotate a single live `<h1>` post-JS, but crawlers see all N). Author the **first/primary** slide's headline as the page `<h1>` and every other slide's headline as `<h2>` — the block reads them generically (`querySelector('h1,h2…')`) so the carousel still works, and the server HTML has one `<h1>` (#35). Local-QA: count `<h1>` in the *content* file = 1.

**A multi-row head/intro must be collected whole, not just its first row (#56).** A block that takes "the first row with no image" as the head breaks when the head is authored as N separate single-cell rows (eyebrow / heading / CTA): only the eyebrow becomes the head and the section heading + CTA leak into the item grid as bogus cards (the section title then renders at card-title size). The head is **everything before the first content/image cell** — collect ALL leading no-image rows into the head. (Inverse of #52's flattening.) Local-QA: the item grid holds exactly the expected count, and the section heading renders at section-title size.

**DEFAULT to the DA-flattened single-cell contract (#62 — the root cause of most decode bugs).** When block JS and the content page are generated in the same run, they MUST agree on the row shape — and DA delivers most blocks as ONE row with ONE cell holding all elements as flat siblings, NOT the rich multi-row layout the prototype implies. A block written to a multi-row index contract (`rows[0]=eyebrow, rows[1]=title, rows[2]=cards…`) then reads its whole cell as `rows[0]` and finds `rows[1..]` undefined — rendering 1-of-N (a jumbled hero, a card grid with one card) while passing lint. So make **flatten-first the default**, via a CELL-LEVEL cascade collector (#68/#71) — NOT a single selector and NOT a block-level fallback chain. The trap (#71): a block-level chain (try `:scope>div>div>*` on the whole block, else…) succeeds on the first tier whenever ANY cell has a child element, so in a block that MIXES element cells (`img`/`h1`/`a`) with text-only cells (eyebrow, lede, count, meta, date) it returns only the element cells and **silently drops every bare-text cell** — the most common one-element-per-row DA shape. The canonical collector iterates CELLS and recovers each:
```js
function collectNodes(block) {
  const out = [];
  block.querySelectorAll(':scope > div > div').forEach((cell) => {
    const kids = [...cell.children];
    if (kids.length) out.push(...kids);
    else if (cell.textContent.trim()) { const p = document.createElement('p'); p.textContent = cell.textContent.trim(); out.push(p); }
  });
  return out.length ? out : [...block.children]; // last-ditch: direct children
}
```
Then segment/classify the returned nodes by content; one-cell-per-row is a fallback. **Local-QA: assert every block's primary content container is non-empty post-decorate (childCount>0 / height>0)** — a 0-node selector mismatch otherwise renders a silent blank box (a blank hero only surfaces via a per-block height probe; testimonials surfaced as a CONTENT GAP). **Local-QA / Checklist assertion:** after `decorate()`, the rendered count must equal the authored count — the hero wrap is non-empty and has the `<h1>`; a card grid holds N cards (= N repeat-headings in source), never 1. Index-based contracts pass lint but silently render 1/N.

**Card grids that alternate ground: reconstruct the rhythm by INDEX when no marker survives (#61).** A prototype encodes a grid's light/dark alternation structurally (the 2nd card has `--dark`), but that marker does NOT survive into DA content. A block that flips dark only on an explicit authored "dark" cell renders every card light — the dark card's white heading/CTA go invisible (caught by the #59 `SURFACE/GROUND MISMATCH` flag). Fallback to the positional pattern: `const dark = explicitMarker ?? (i % 2 === 1)`. Then scope on-dark button/text overrides to the resulting `.card.dark` block class (#41).

**This applies to EVERY block, not just hero (#48).** The author's row/cell layout is rarely the contract the agent assumed — a block that hard-codes `rows[4] = <dl> data cell` silently drops content when the content authors one `dt|dd` pair per row instead, and a `[num]|[label]` two-cell assumption duplicates the eyebrow when the author wrote a single `"01 — Title"` cell. These are **silent**: the page still renders something, and the metrics-only diff (stretch/flush/blank) does NOT catch a dropped CTA, a duplicated eyebrow, or an empty data grid. Classify rows/cells by content — presence of a heading, a `<picture>`, a link, a number prefix (`/^\d+/`), a 2-cell `dt|dd` shape — never by `block.children[N]`. **When DA flattens content, it becomes "one line per row, delimiters carry structure" (#50) — so DECODE defensively.** (ENCODE is the opposite: when the generator controls authoring, do NOT invent delimiters — lead each sub-field with a preserved tag instead; see **The ENCODE contract**. A block parses delimiters only as a back-compat fallback.) DA/snowflake content rarely preserves the prototype's semantic `<dl>`/`<dt>`/`<dd>`/`<ol>`/`<ul>`/`<li>` — it flattens them to a sequence of single-cell `<p>` rows with INLINE delimiters: `Address: PLACEHOLDER · Brand team to supply` (key:value), `01 · Tabernacle · Imp. Stout · 6.5%` (`·`-delimited spec line), `Heber Valley · Utah · Est 1996` (a plain foot line). So a block that `querySelector('dl, dt')` or `'ol, ul, li'` finds NOTHING and silently drops the whole data table / spec list / menu. **Parse by delimiters, not tags:** split `Key: value` on the first colon into `dt`/`dd`; split `·`-delimited lines into spans; detect a list's start by its preceding heading (`On tap this week`), not an `<ol>`. (Even #48's "one `dt|dd` pair per row" misses this — the row is ONE cell, not two.) Checklist: for any table/spec-list/menu block, assert post-decorate that the data container has the expected non-zero row count.

**Repeating card/tile grids: DA flattens N units into ONE cell — segment, don't iterate rows (#52).** A section that is a grid/band of N similar units (a 3-up card grid, a 2-up tile band, a logo row, a team grid) is very often collapsed by DA into a SINGLE cell of a SINGLE row, with each unit's elements (heading, picture, paragraphs, link) as flat siblings. A block written one-DOM-row-per-card then renders **0 cards** (the whole grid collapses into the section header) or **1** — silently dropping every other product/tile. Detect the flattened shape (`rows.length === 1` with multiple headings in the cell) and **segment the flat sibling list into one group per repeating heading**. The repeat-unit boundary is the **most frequent heading tag** in the cell (cards are `h3`; the lone section title is `h2` one level up) — segmenting on "any heading" turns the section title into a phantom first card. Support BOTH the flat-single-cell and the one-row-per-unit shapes. **Segmentation order (#63, #73):** (0) **one-row-per-card** — if ≥2 `:scope > div` ROWS each contain a card heading (`h3`/`h4`), build one group per ROW from `[...row.children]` in AUTHORED field order (treat leading non-card-heading rows as the section head); never assume a `tag → media → heading` field order — content authored `media → tag → heading` otherwise attributes each card's image to the PREVIOUS card and drops the first card's (a 1-of-N image shift that passes a card-COUNT check, #73); ELSE (1) per-card heading boundary if present; ELSE (2) **one card per delimited `<p>` line** — when the cards carry no per-card heading (only the section title), each card is a single `Name · meta · meta · Badge` line (the natural way to author a short card): split on the unit delimiter (`·`), first segment = name, a trailing keyword (`New`/`Limited`/`Sold out`…) = badge, the middle = meta; ELSE (3) one-row-per-unit. This unifies #50 (delimiter parsing) and #52 (card segmentation) for the headingless card/tile rail that falls between them (it silently renders 0 cards otherwise — the section heading still shows, so only the #49 CONTENT GAP / a card-count assert catches it). Local-QA: assert the grid count EVEN WHEN the block found no per-card headings (that's the case that returns 0), AND that each card's image src matches its OWN title (#73 — an image shifted by one passes a count-only check). **Never use `<picture>` as the PRIMARY card boundary (#64):** image-led prototypes tempt "the picture leads each card", but claude-design content is usually image-less (#2), so a picture-keyed split collapses N cards into 1. Segment on the per-card heading first; treat the picture only as a hint for which segment owns the media. (If a grid renders 1-of-N, suspect a picture-keyed boundary with no heading fallback.)

**Classifiers must match the element ITSELF or a descendant (#53), and media must match `picture, img` (#72).** In the flattened shape the segmented "cells" are bare sibling elements (an `<img>`, an `<a>`, an `<h3>`), so `cell.querySelector('img')` returns null and the content silently vanishes. Classify with `el.matches(sel) || el.querySelector(sel)`. For MEDIA, always test `picture, img` (not just `picture`) — un-pipelined/harness content and pasted external URLs deliver a bare `<img>` with no `<picture>` wrapper: `const media = el.matches('picture, img') ? el : el.querySelector('picture, img')`. (Likewise A / `Hn`.)

Always pair with a per-section screenshot eyeball (#23) and the `CONTENT GAP` probe flag (#49) — a heading/contentBox-count or main-height delta vs the proto means content was dropped or duplicated.

**Headings — exactly one `<h1>` per page + a real outline (#35).** Prototype headlines are usually styled `<div>`/`<span>`s with no heading semantics. Promote them: the hero/lead block renders its headline as the page's **single `<h1>`**; every other section title renders as `<h2>` (sub-items `<h3>`). Never leave a headline as a bare `<div>` — the `<h1>` is the strongest on-page relevance signal, it's the source of the page `<title>` (#34), and the outline drives crawlers, AI answer engines, and screen readers (WCAG). This applies to **interactive blocks too**: a flow/quiz/dashboard renders its lead title as `<h1>` in its server-visible markup, not just after JS. (Symptom this prevents: a converted page with zero `<h*>` elements, or sibling `<h2>`s with no `<h1>`.)

**Interactive blocks (#28).** When the prototype section is a stateful component (a selector, a filter, a form that mutates data, a multi-step flow), reproduce it as **one self-contained interactive block that owns the state** — block JS runs, so this is fully supported:
- **Data → keyed authorable rows.** For heterogeneous data, key each row by its first cell (`account | id | name | …`, `txn | date | desc | …`) and parse by key. Homogeneous lists are just one row per item.
- **Behavior → local state + targeted re-render.** Hold a mutable `state` object; write small `render*()` functions (e.g. `renderCards()`, `renderList()`) and re-invoke only the affected one on each interaction — the manual equivalent of a React re-render. A form that mutates data validates, updates `state`, re-renders the affected parts (cards, totals, `<option>`s), and shows a confirmation.
- This mirrors lifting state to a parent in React: if several widgets share data, put them in **one** block rather than trying to sync state across blocks. (Cross-block coordination, if ever needed, is a DOM `CustomEvent`.)
- **Sequential flow vs. addressable views — pick the right decomposition (#33).** A *sequential* flow whose views are entered from one starting point and are not independently addressable (search → results → seats → confirm; an onboarding wizard; a checkout) is **one block** with a `state.view` field and a `render()` dispatcher that `replaceChildren()`s the active view. This is the inverse of #29: *independently-addressable* views with **different chrome** become **multiple pages**. Rule of thumb — sequential-from-one-entry → one block; addressable-with-own-chrome → pages.
- **QA the behavior, not just the paint** — see Local QA: drive each control and assert the state change. (When asserting computed style right after a click, move the pointer off the element and let CSS transitions settle first, or a mid-`transition`/`:hover` read gives a false negative.)

### 9. Content page scaffold

**Every content page MUST begin with a `metadata` block (#34).** At minimum it carries a **Title** (~50–60 chars: brand + primary keyword/location, derived from the page's real `<h1>` — NEVER a block or section name) and a **Description** (~150–160 chars summarising the page). Skip it and EDS derives `<title>` from the first content cell — junk like `<title>Hero</title>` / `<title>Quiz</title>` — and emits no description; and because EDS **mirrors Title/Description into `og:`/`twitter:`**, that junk poisons social/AI share cards too. Authoring this one block resolves title, description, og:title, og:description, twitter:title and twitter:description at once. `header: off` / `footer: off` / `Robots` rows go in the same block when needed (the pipeline extracts the block wherever it sits in `<main>` — first or last). The static header/footer fragments still load automatically via `postlcp.js`; no other per-page configuration is required.

**The content page is a DA *body fragment* (#7).** The DA Source API (the headless deploy path) requires the document to start at `<body>` — **no `<!DOCTYPE>`, no `<html>`, no `<head>`** (the pipeline injects head/scripts/styles from Code Bus). Emit exactly:

```html
<body>
  <header></header>
  <main>
    <div>
      <div class="metadata">
        <div><div>Title</div><div>Brand — primary keyword / location (≤60 chars, from the &lt;h1&gt;)</div></div>
        <div><div>Description</div><div>A 150–160 character summary of the page.</div></div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div class="hero">
        <div><div><h1>The page's lead headline</h1></div></div>
        <div><div>body copy</div></div>
        <div><div><strong><a href="/path">Primary CTA</a></strong> <em><a href="/path">Secondary CTA</a></em></div></div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <!-- next section: its title decorates to <h2> -->
    </div>
  </main>
  <footer></footer>
</body>
```

(Only the **mount-based** deploy tolerates a full `<!DOCTYPE html><html>…</html>` document — it strips `<head>` on ingestion. For the Source-API/`curl` path, emit the body fragment above. Before any DA write, run `node skills/deploy/scripts/sanitise.js <file>` to encode non-ASCII — `® · – —`, accents, emoji — to HTML entities, or DA corrupts them to U+FFFD.)

To suppress header/footer on a specific page, add `header: off` and/or `footer: off` rows to that same `metadata` block:

```html
    <div>
      <div class="metadata">
        <div><div>header</div><div>off</div></div>
      </div>
    </div>
```

**Multi-view SPA → multiple pages (#29).** If the prototype is a single-page app with several views that have **different chrome** (e.g. a marketing home with a full nav vs. a signed-in dashboard with a minimal bar), convert **each view to its own EDS page** (pre-render each per #27) and link them with real hrefs. Since `postlcp.js` loads ONE shared `fragments/header.html` for the whole site, two different headers can't both be the fragment: keep the most representative header as the fragment, and on the other page set **`header: off`** (metadata above) and render that page's header as a **block** (`site-nav`) at the top of its content. Share the footer fragment if the footer is the same. (Harness caveat: the `metadata` block is consumed by the delivery pipeline into a `<head>` `<meta>`, but the local harness has no pipeline — so it won't apply `header: off` and will try to load `metadata` as a block, showing a stray error. Strip the `<header>` element from the harness to preview a header-off page; it's a non-issue live.)

**Do NOT emit a `<head>` element.** EDS content pages are markdown-equivalent fragments: the document metadata (title, meta, stylesheets, scripts) lives in the project's `head.html`, which EDS injects at delivery time. A `<head>` block in a content page is dead weight at best and a duplication conflict at worst.

When the prototype has **real** images, AUTHORED content `<img src>` URLs must point at a host the preview ingester can fetch — **prefer `https://content.da.live/{org}/{repo}/media/<scope>/<file>`** (branch-independent; upload the binary via the Source API first — see **The ENCODE contract → Images**). A fully-qualified `https://main--<repo>--<owner>.aem.page/…` also ingests but is branch-locked. **NEVER** a repo-relative `/img/…` in authored content — it delivers as `<img src="about:error">`. **This applies ONLY to authored content `<img>` — NOT to fixed assets referenced as CSS backgrounds from block JS/CSS (#67): those stay root-relative `/img/<brand>/…` (anti-pattern 9b), browser-fetched and never ingested.** When the prototype uses **`<image-slot>` placeholders** (no real assets — common for claude-design prototypes), leave the image cells EMPTY (`<div></div>`); the block CSS background fallback (Step 7) renders the section correctly without an image. The author drops real images in later.

## Local QA before deploy (no DA)

`aem up --html-folder content` is **not** a reliable way to preview new pages: it serves repo files statically and only renders a path through the full pipeline if that path is already in the remote routing index — brand-new paths 404 on the rendered route. To verify decoration locally, build a **self-contained harness** and open it through the dev server (which serves repo code at its real paths):

```bash
# 1. dev server (serves /scripts, /styles, /blocks, /fragments at their real paths)
npx -y @adobe/aem-cli up --no-open &

# 2. harness — use the committed helper (do NOT hand-roll the metadata strip, #46):
#    it removes the metadata block by balanced tag-counting and rewrites absolute
#    /img/ URLs to root-relative (#43), then emits the full harness doc.
node skills/deploy/scripts/build-harness.mjs content/<path>.html qa/page.html   # qa/ is gitignored
```

Open `http://localhost:3000/qa/page.html` — `scripts.js` runs `loadArea()`, blocks load from the code origin, fragments inject via `postlcp.js`. Screenshot / inspect with headless Chrome (`--virtual-time-budget=9000 --screenshot` / `--dump-dom`) or Playwright.

**Before any DA push, run the whole-page round-trip gate (#94)** — `block-roundtrip.mjs` with no `--blocks` (all blocks, DA-free): it catches cross-block drops a per-block run can miss (a section head absorbed by the wrong block, an instance-count mismatch between authored blocks and prototype sections).

**Capture at a real viewport and scroll — not one giant window (#19).** A `min-height:100vh` hero becomes *window-tall* under a huge capture window (e.g. 7800px), pushing its centered content far down and off the top crop — it looks like the hero text vanished. Instead, use Playwright at a normal viewport (e.g. 1440×900) and `scrollIntoView()` each section before each screenshot.

**Visually diff each section against the prototype (#23).** Programmatic checks (width, decoration counts, interactivity) pass things the eye catches — header alignment, intentional line breaks (`<br>`), heading **weight**, and a section root's **background/color** (e.g. a footer that should be a brand color but renders on the body background). Open the prototype itself (`<x-dc>`/JSX prototypes self-render from their file via their `support.js`/bundle) and the harness at the **same viewport, section by section**, and compare.

**Drive interactive blocks and assert state changes (#28).** For any interactive block, don't stop at the static render — Playwright-drive each control and assert the result: click a selector/tab → expect the active item / filtered count to change; submit an invalid form → expect the error text; submit a valid one → assert the visible state changed (e.g. a balance went `$4,862.13 → $3,862.13`, a confirmation appeared). Run the same drive against the **deployed** preview too — block JS that worked in the harness can still trip on CSP or a missing dependency live.

**Wide-viewport layout check (#13).** Always QA at a **wide** viewport (≥1600px), not just 1440 — a missing max-width container is invisible where the 1320 max ≈ the viewport. Measure each block's inner content width and flag anything spanning full width that shouldn't:

```js
// Playwright, viewport 1600: for each block, is the content constrained?
for (const n of ['hero','quick','used','stats','service','offers','brands','locations']) {
  const w = await page.evaluate((sel) => {
    const inner = document.querySelector(`.${sel} .wrap`) || document.querySelector(`.${sel}`).firstElementChild;
    return Math.round(inner.getBoundingClientRect().width);
  }, n);
  console.log(n, w, w > 1340 ? '<== FULL-WIDTH (check against prototype)' : '');
}
```

Cross-check each flag against the prototype: full-bleed is correct only where the prototype section has no inner max-width wrapper.

## Step 10 — Visual + structural diff & reconcile (content-diff REQUIRED)

After deploy, reconcile the EDS page against the source prototype with **two complementary probes — run BOTH** (#78). They catch disjoint failure classes; either alone gives a false "looks fine":

**The `content-diff` per-instance/role check is a REQUIRED gate for the first page of each template (#92),
not optional.** The atomic-delivery gates verify structure/layout (one `<h1>`, grids compute `grid`) and
pass GREEN while a per-instance detail is wrong — a card grid styled uniformly when one card is accent, an
active chip rendered like its siblings. Those are exactly the misses `content-diff` sees and the layout
gates cannot. So the page is not `deployed` until `content-diff` shows **0 structural 🔴** for the first
page of each template. Pair it with the Step 1 fingerprint (#90): the fingerprint catches the variation
BEFORE block code, `content-diff` confirms it survived DA AFTER deploy.

**With #93–#95 in place, Step 10 is the PROOF, not the repair loop.** Every block already passed
`block-roundtrip` (#94) before deploy, so the first Step-10 run should be GREEN. What Step 10 adds
over the in-loop gate is the DA TRANSPORT: a 🔴 here that #94 did not show means the pipeline
reshaped the content (a stripped tag, an unwrapped `<p>` #79, a flattened row #50/#62) — fix the
decode's flattened-shape fallback, then re-run both. If Step 10 keeps being where defects are first
FOUND, the loop is being run out of order.

1. **`skills/diff/scripts/visual-diff.mjs` — the PIXEL/layout probe.** Reasons about rendered geometry: stretched images (#36), dropped max-width wraps (#37), blank renders (#40), surface/ground colour flips (#59). Good at "this looks broken." STRUCTURALLY BLIND to "the right text is in the wrong slot" or "one CTA is gone" — those keep full pixels and plausible colours, so no flag fires.
2. **`skills/diff/scripts/content-diff.mjs` — the STRUCTURAL content+type probe.** Extracts an ordered, role-classified inventory ({heading, eyebrow, cta+href, body}) from each `<main>` — classifying by computed style + tag so the prototype's `.ds-*` DOM and the EDS block DOM compare symmetrically — and DIFFS them: `MISSING CTA/HEADING/EYEBROW` (🔴 dropped content — caught the `the-place` CTA), `ROLE SWAP` (🔴 same text, wrong slot — caught the `the-people` eyebrow↔body scramble #76), `MISSING BODY`/`EXTRA` (🟡 placeholder→real-copy or invented prose), and `FONT FORK` (🟠 a matched line whose rendered FACE differs, by **width probe** not `document.fonts.check` — the #77 method, grouped into one advisory). This is the layer the pixel probe can't see.

Neither is a pixel diff — both use computed-style/geometry measurements; pixels are noise (fonts, animation, dynamic mock data).

```bash
# Prereq: a RENDERABLE prototype. Static → serve from its own dir so relative
# ../assets resolve. JSX → pre-render first (#24/#27).
( cd <prototype-dir> && python3 -m http.server 8791 & )

node skills/diff/scripts/visual-diff.mjs \
  "http://localhost:8791/<prototype>.html" \
  "https://<branch>--<repo>--<owner>.aem.page/<path>" \
  --profile eds --sections ".hero,.feature-tabs,.compare"   # optional per-section shots

# Structural content + typography diff (same two URLs). Use the LIVE/harness EDS
# URL so blocks are decorated; a raw content .plain.html has no roles to classify.
node skills/diff/scripts/content-diff.mjs \
  "http://localhost:8791/<prototype>.html" \
  "https://<branch>--<repo>--<owner>.aem.page/<path>" \
  --profile eds   # --json to dump both inventories
```

Both probes are owned by the **`stardust:diff`** skill and share
`skills/diff/scripts/diff-profiles.mjs`. The `--profile eds` flag supplies the EDS/DA remediation
language used in the flag messages below; the comparison engines are stack-agnostic
(`--profile generic` for non-EDS builds).

Read the output:
- **Red flags (advisory)** — `BLANK RENDER` (hidden/empty page → #40, a `body{display:none}` gate or harness load failure — fix before trusting anything else); `IMAGE DID NOT LOAD` (rendered box, natural 0×0 → #43, the harness `<img>` 404'd); `STRETCHED IMAGE` (raster aspect ≠ natural → #36, add `height:auto`); `FLUSH-LEFT TEXT` (a left-anchored heading/para at left≈0 → #37, the owning block dropped its max-width wrap). A clean page prints "none".
- **Harness images (#43):** when building the off-pipeline qa harness, rewrite absolute `…aem.page/img/...` `<img src>` to root-relative `/img/...` (the asset is committed locally) — otherwise the image 404s, natural dims are 0×0, and the stretch check silently skips.
- **Metrics JSON** — compare `proto` vs `eds`: `eyebrows`/`headings` colors (catches #38 — a primitive styled in the prototype but dropped in one block), `images` dims, and `contentBoxes` (each block's content width + left offset; a wrapped block sits at left ≈ (viewport−maxw)/2 + padding, a dropped-wrap block at left ≈ 0).
- **Screenshots** in the `--out` dir (default `qa/`): open the full-page pair and any per-section shots and confirm fidelity.

- **Justified vs defect `STRETCHED IMAGE` (#45):** a stretch flag is JUSTIFIED — leave the CSS — when (a) the image is an `object-fit: cover` intentional full-bleed background/watermark, OR (b) the SAME flag appears on the proto side of the diff (a faithful lift of the prototype's own `height:Npx; padding; box-sizing:border-box` rule). "Fixing" a faithful flag only makes the EDS diverge. Treat it as a real defect ONLY when the proto renders the image at its natural AR but the EDS does not.
- **Pre-deploy URL gate (#44):** `grep -rn "http://localhost\|aem\.page/img\|aem\.live/img" blocks/` MUST be empty. Block JS that injects fixed imagery (logos/icons/watermarks) must reference assets root-relative `/img/...`; an absolute origin baked into block JS passes local QA (the dev server is localhost:3000) but 404s in every real environment.

- **`FONT MISMATCH` (#66):** a heading whose named display/body family loaded in the proto but NOT in the EDS = a missing `@font-face` falling back to serif/sans (#65). Ship the woff2 self-hosted + root-relative.
- **`SURFACE/GROUND MISMATCH` (#59):** a heading that matches the proto by text but renders a materially different color (luminance flipped dark↔light) means its band rendered on the wrong ground (e.g. a light intro band fused into a dark scene, #58). Check the owning block's section background.
- **GAP flags are WHOLE-PAGE, independent of `--sections` (#54):** `IMAGERY GAP` (#47) and `CONTENT GAP` (#49) are computed page-wide; `--sections` only chooses which per-section *screenshots* are saved. So a focused `--sections .hero` run whose hero looks perfect can STILL fire a GAP pointing at a defect in a *different* block (e.g. services dropping 3/4 cards). Never dismiss a GAP flag as "outside my section" — when either fires, run an UNSCOPED full-page diff (or a per-section diff on the suspect block) and locate the dropped/duplicated content before trusting the focused pass.

**Reading `content-diff` (#78):**
- **`MISSING CTA/HEADING/EYEBROW` (🔴):** real dropped content — FIX. A missing eyebrow is most often a segmentation drop (#76, the eyebrow precedes its heading); a missing CTA means the block never authored/rendered the link cell. These are the failures the pixel probe cannot see (full pixels, plausible colours) — treat 🔴 as blocking.
- **`ROLE SWAP` (🔴):** the same text rendered under a different role (body painted as eyebrow, eyebrow folded into a teaser) — the #76 mis-classification class. FIX the owning block's node segmentation.
- **`MISSING BODY` / `EXTRA` (🟡):** body prose dropped, or EDS copy with no proto source. Usually fine — a prototype placeholder ("two paragraphs of prose live here…") legitimately becomes real authored copy. CONFIRM it's an intended rewrite, not lost/hallucinated prose.
- **`FONT FORK` (🟠):** matched lines whose rendered FACE differs (width probe). A `proto X→sys` means the prototype named font X but never loaded it and fell back to system — EDS self-hosting the intended fallback is then CORRECT (#77), not a bug. Confirm the fork is intended; if instead EDS is the one falling back, ship the missing `@font-face`. The probe groups all forked lines into ONE advisory (a proprietary→fallback swap fires on every display line).
- The summary line counts nodes per role on each side — a large `headings`/`cta` count delta is itself a fast dropped-section signal before reading individual flags.

Fix the flagged few, then re-run BOTH probes until visual red flags are "none" (or justified) and content-diff shows **0 structural 🔴** (🟡/🟠 confirmed intended). The flag lists double as a regression checklist — seeded from the findings above, so a new silent regression is worth adding both a fix AND a probe signal.

## Anti-patterns (lessons paid for the hard way)

These look reasonable. They will cost a full reset.

**1. Abstracting prototype sections into "blocks with variants."**
Building one `hero` block with five class-variant treatments (`dark` / `light` / `image` / `full-bleed` / `with-wave`) seems DRY. In practice the variants don't share enough markup or CSS to compress; the JS forks too many ways; CSS gets brittle. **Build one block per distinct prototype section.** Reuse only when sections are byte-identical.

**1b. Merging two prototype bands that have different `data-ground`/surfaces (#58).**
A cinematic/editorial prototype often alternates ground bands — a light `data-ground="dust"` intro (dark heading) followed by a dark `data-ground="ink"` scene (light heading). Fusing them into one block rendered on a single ground silently **inverts** the lost band (its heading flips dark↔light, the design beat vanishes) — lint passes, all content present, only an eyeball or the `SURFACE/GROUND MISMATCH` probe flag (#59) catches it. If one block must span >1 ground, reproduce EACH ground as a distinct full-bleed sub-band inside it (a `.loop-head` light sub-band + the dark scene), never collapse to one. Audit cue: note each section's `data-ground` before merging; a cross-ground merge must preserve both.

**2. Section-metadata style classes that parallel block variants.**
Defining `.section.dark`, `.section.prose-2col`, `.section.eyebrow`, etc. and applying them via section-metadata adds a second styling system that overlaps with block CSS. Authors don't know whether to set `dark` on the section or on the block. Pick one path: **per-block CSS that paints the entire section.** No section-style classes.

**3. Shared utility modules (waves, animation primitives).**
A wave SVG that all blocks import seems reusable. But each prototype section uses its wave differently (different dimensions, colors, animation). Inlining the SVG inside the owning block is more code on paper but eliminates a coupling and makes each block self-contained.

**4. Manually creating button anchors in block JS.**
Code like `cta.className = 'btn-loud'; cta.innerHTML = '<span>…</span>' + ARROW_SVG;` duplicates the EDS button decorator's job, fights its class-application order, and ties block JS to specific button classes. **Clone the cell anchor; let `decorateButton()` apply the class.** Block CSS overrides the global button style only when something is actually different (size, hover variant).

**5. Building complex block JS to parse and rebuild header/footer.**
The old pattern (fetch flat DA fragment → parse structurally → rebuild DOM) is fragile and lossy. Static fragments (`fragments/header.html`, `fragments/footer.html`) are injected verbatim — no parsing, no rebuild. If you find yourself writing block JS for header/footer, stop. Extract the prototype's header/footer as-is.

**6. `.default-content-wrapper` (or any guess about EDS's section DOM).**
The actual EDS shape is `<div class="section"><div class="default-content">…</div><div class="block-content">…</div></div>`. Confirm by inspecting a rendered page in the browser before designing CSS that relies on the wrapping shape.

**7. Doing the audit in too much depth.**
A 22-pattern audit produces abstractions. You only need a per-page section list. Pattern reuse emerges organically when you find two byte-identical sections.

**8. Building before locking decisions.**
Naming + reuse decisions look small but ripple through every block and content page. **Surface 3–5 naming questions to the user up front.** Lock answers in writing before any block code.

**9. Generic placeholder image paths.**
`/img/case-studies/foo.jpg` will 404 unless those images are uploaded. Use the prototype host URL so what you author renders correctly in EDS preview from day one.

**9b. Absolute-origin URLs baked into block CODE — JS string literals AND CSS `background-image: url(...)` (#44, #67).**
ANY fixed brand asset referenced from block code — a JS string literal (logo/icon/watermark/fallback) OR a CSS `background-image: url("…")` (a full-bleed section wash) — must be root-relative `/img/<brand>/x.png`, NEVER an absolute origin (`http://localhost:3000/img/...`, a branch `--…aem.page/img/...` host). An absolute origin passes local QA (the dev server *is* localhost:3000, so it loads) but 404s on every real environment. **This directly overrides anti-pattern #9 / the Step-9 "fully-qualified host URL" rule for fixed block assets (#67):** that rule applies ONLY to AUTHORED content `<img src>` for *uploaded/Media-Bus* assets — fixed imagery in block CSS/JS (section backgrounds, watermarks, CSS fallbacks) is always root-relative. (Cinematic prototypes lean on CSS background washes, so this is common.) Gate before deploy: `grep -rn "http://localhost\|aem\.page/img\|aem\.live/img" blocks/` must be empty (it scans CSS too).

**10. Touching `head.html` for fonts (preload included).**
Google Fonts `<link>` tags, Adobe Fonts script tags, any CDN-hosted stylesheet, AND `<link rel="preload" as="font">` lines all belong out of `head.html`. The first three add DNS/handshake hops and external coupling; the preload looks helpful but it's not — the metric-matched `body.session` pattern (principle 3) makes preload irrelevant for CLS, and adding it splits font discovery between two files. Declare `@font-face` in `styles/styles.css` only. Self-host proprietary brand faces too (for fidelity) and raise the licensing alert (#80) — only keep a CDN load when you genuinely cannot obtain the font files, and then document the CDN coupling + CLS trade-off.

**11. Skipping the metric-matched fallback `@font-face`.**
Without `size-adjust` + `ascent-override` + `descent-override` on a system-font fallback, the swap from system font → brand font shifts every line of text on the page when the woff2 lands. For a variable brand, lift the calibration from the matching `@fontsource-variable/<name>` package; for a **non-variable** brand (static weights only, no published Fallback face), compute it from the woff2 with fonttools (Step 4, #11). Rename the override `@font-face` after the system font (`"Arial"`, `"Times New Roman"`) so any reference to that family in a font stack picks up the adjusted metrics automatically.

**12. Over-applying the button convention.**
Not every link is a button. Whole-card tile anchors, tel:/mailto: channel values, and styled text links (e.g. wavelength-underlined "How we work →") are NOT buttons. Authors leave these as plain `<a>`; per-block CSS styles them. **The convention is for chips with a clickable boundary; if it's not that, don't apply it.**

**13. Dropping the prototype's max-width container.**
The prototype wraps section content in a centered max-width container (`.wrap` / `.container`) while the section background bleeds full-width. If your block appends content straight to the block root, the content runs edge-to-edge at wide viewports. **Recreate the container** (`block.replaceChildren(wrap)`, or a CSS `max-width: var(--maxw); margin: 0 auto; padding: 0 24px` on the content). This is the easiest bug to miss because it's invisible at ≤1440px — QA wide (see Local QA). Parallel block agents are especially prone to this: state the rule in each brief. **The trap is worst on plain-background sections (#37):** agents reliably keep the wrap on full-bleed *banded* blocks (the colored background makes the edge obvious) but drop it on sections whose background is the page background — there the missing constraint is invisible until you measure. EVERY block constrains content to `--maxw`; the only thing that stays full-bleed is a section *background* (e.g. keep the wrap on the inner grid so a hero's wash background still spans the viewport). **And the wrapper must be STYLED, not just emitted (#74):** a block whose JS writes `class="wrap"` but whose CSS never defines `.{block} .wrap { max-width: var(--maxw); margin: 0 auto; padding: 0 24px }` flushes left exactly the same — the markup looks right, the rule is just absent (it only shows when no inner card supplies its own padding). Gate: for every block whose JS emits a `.wrap`/container class, grep its CSS for the matching rule.

**14. Forgetting `<image-slot>` placeholders have no real assets.**
Claude-design prototypes use `<image-slot>` drop-targets, not `<img>` with real `src`. Don't hard-code a prototype image URL (it 404s) and don't ship a broken `<img>`. Treat the image as an **optional** cell and give the block a CSS background fallback so the empty state still looks right.

**15. Loading the footer twice (block + static fragment).**
The AuthorKit `lazy.js` lazy-loads `utils/footer.js` → `loadBlock(footer)`. With static chrome fragments (this skill) and no `blocks/footer`, that throws and renders a visible "Error" box between the last section and the footer. Remove the `utils/footer.js` import from `lazy.js` during Runtime bootstrap.

**16. Lifting a JS-toggled `opacity:0` reveal.**
Prototypes often hide sections with `.reveal { opacity:0 }` and reveal them via an inline-`<script>` IntersectionObserver. That script doesn't run in EDS, so the lifted `opacity:0` makes the content **permanently invisible** — and it looks fine in the prototype, so it's easy to miss. Render content visible; drop the reveal. (Same root cause as anti-pattern 5 and the fragment-JS rule: prototype `<script>` never executes after conversion.)

**17. Injecting a `<main>` element from block JS.**
A block that builds its own layout/view wrapper (common for interactive blocks that swap views, #33) must NOT use `<main>` — or a bare top-level `<div>` that the foundation reset matches. The reset hides undecorated sections with `main > div { display:none }`; an injected `<main>` makes its child `<div>`s direct children of *a* `main`, so they get `display:none` and the view renders **blank/partial**. It's **silent** — lint passes, no console error; only the missing content shows it. Use a `<section>` (or keep injected nodes scoped under the block element, which never trips `main > div`). Don't port a prototype's `<main>` wrapper literally into block-injected DOM.

## Checklist (per page)

- [ ] Each section in the prototype `<main>` has a corresponding block call in the content page.
- [ ] **Content page is a body fragment** for the Source-API deploy: starts at `<body>`, **no `<!DOCTYPE>`/`<html>`/`<head>`** — EDS injects the project `head.html` at delivery. (Only the mount deploy tolerates a full doc.)
- [ ] Ran `node skills/deploy/scripts/sanitise.js` on the content before any DA write (non-ASCII → entities).
- [ ] **Per-instance variation fingerprinted (#90)** — ran `style-fingerprint.mjs` on the prototype BEFORE block code; every group with >1 style/structural cluster (active chip, accent CTA, image vs image-less card) is reproduced by its block, not flattened.
- [ ] **Token-completeness clean (#91)** — every `var(--x)` referenced in `blocks/**/*.css` is defined in `styles.css` `:root` (the `comm -23` grep prints nothing); no undefined-var-dropped background/color.
- [ ] **`content-diff` shows 0 structural 🔴 (#92)** for the first page of each template — required, not optional.
- [ ] **Section schema emitted + used (#93)** — `stardust/eds-schema/<page>.json` exists; authored rows follow its order/units; each block's JSDoc cites its section's schema; deliberate drops recorded in the conversion log.
- [ ] **Every block passed `block-roundtrip` BEFORE deploy (#94)** — exit 0 (0 structural 🔴) per block against its prototype section, plus one whole-page run (no `--blocks`) clean before the DA push.
- [ ] **Decode tier chosen per section (#95)** — bespoke fixed-composition sections are template-slotted (verbatim prototype DOM + role slots); only repeat/authorable sections are reconstructive; tiers recorded in the conversion log.
- [ ] `<header></header>` and `<footer></footer>` are EMPTY (static fragments load automatically via `postlcp.js`).
- [ ] **Page begins with a `metadata` block** (#34): real Title (≤60 chars, from the `<h1>`, never a block name) + Description (~155 chars). `header: off` / `footer: off` / `Robots` rows go in the same block when needed.
- [ ] **Exactly one `<h1>` per page** (#35): the hero/lead headline is `<h1>`; section titles are `<h2>`/`<h3>`; no headline left as a bare `<div>` (interactive blocks included — the lead title is `<h1>` in server-visible markup).
- [ ] **Editorial images are authorable content** — uploaded to DA `/media`, authored as `content.da.live` `<img>` with `alt` (NOT repo-relative `/img/`, NOT baked into block JS by index). Hero/feature/CTA-band backgrounds count as editorial. Decorative image-less treatments (gradients/scrims/washes) and fixed brand assets stay CSS background. **Verify: the delivered `.plain.html` carries the expected `<img>`+alt count** (CSS-background images are absent from it). `<image-slot>` placeholders → empty cells with a CSS background fallback.
- [ ] **ENCODE shapes (see The ENCODE contract):** grouped bands = one row per item; FAQ/accordion = head cell + Q/A rows; sub-fields carried by a leading `<strong>`/`<code>` tag, **not** an invented `::`/`|` delimiter; accents `<em>` not `<span class="em">`; no `<sup>`/layout-`<br>` in content.
- [ ] **Section heads are DEFAULT CONTENT, not block rows** — the eyebrow/heading/lede above a repeating block is authored as section default content; the block reabsorbs it (`block.closest('.block-content').previousElementSibling`; match `.default-content`/`.default-content-wrapper`) so the decorated DOM is byte-identical (verify: 0 wrappers left, decorated outerHTML unchanged).
- [ ] **Same-pattern sections share ONE block + variant classes** (`cards`/`text`/…); only genuinely-unique sections are bespoke (see "The one rule").
- [ ] Heading outline has no level jumps (`h2 → h3`, never `h2 → h4`).
- [ ] Each block reproduces the prototype's max-width container — **including plain-background sections** (#37); **no unintended full-width content at a wide (≥1600px) viewport**.
- [ ] Global `img` reset is `display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;` (#36) — EDS adds width/height attrs; without `height: auto` images stretch vertically.
- [ ] When the header sits in flow above the first section, the bare `<header>` has a reserved responsive `min-height` matching the fragment (#81) — the late `postlcp.js` fragment injection must NOT push the hero down (verify CLS with a fetch-delayed probe; target < 0.1).
- [ ] Any styling that depends on a `<span>`/class INSIDE a block cell is re-created in `decorate()` (#39) — EDS strips `<span>` in block cells (e.g. wrap a `.stars` run in JS, don't author it).
- [ ] Every block reads plain-text fields by CELL/`textContent`, NOT `querySelectorAll('p')` (#79) — the pipeline unwraps the `<p>` in single-text cells, so a `p`-based read drops eyebrow/subhead/lede/tag/body on live while the raw-`<p>` harness still shows them. Verify against the decorated live/preview render or a `<p>`-stripping harness, and assert each text field is present (counts alone don't catch it).
- [ ] No `<style>` or `<script>` tags in the content page.
- [ ] No section-metadata blocks.
- [ ] Closing CTA reuses the shared `closing` block.
- [ ] CTA links are wrapped in `<strong>` (primary) or `<em>` (secondary). Text links and tile-card anchors are plain `<a>`.
- [ ] Block JS exports `default async function decorate(block)` with JSDoc describing rows and noting any button conventions.
- [ ] Block CSS is scoped under `.block-name`.
- [ ] Block CSS does NOT redefine global tokens.
- [ ] Block CSS does NOT redefine global button classes (only legitimate overrides like size or hover variant).
- [ ] SVG markup is inline in the block JS (no shared waves utility).
- [ ] Block JS does NOT manufacture button anchors with custom classes.
- [ ] `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` honored on any animation.
- [ ] No JS-toggled `opacity:0` reveal lifted from the prototype — content renders visible (prototype scroll-reveal script doesn't run in EDS).
- [ ] No block named after a reserved EDS class (`section`, `default-content`, `block-content`, `wrap`, `button`).
- [ ] `head.html` is untouched. No font `<link>`, `<script>`, `<style>`, or `<link rel="preload" as="font">` lines added. All `@font-face` declarations live in `styles/styles.css`. Brand woff2(s) live in `styles/fonts/`.
- [ ] EVERY named brand face is self-hosted — including proprietary ones (#80); proprietary `.otf`/`.ttf` from the prototype were converted to woff2 with fontTools. If any proprietary face is shipped, the **licensing alert** exists in all three places (styles.css banner + `styles/fonts/LICENSING.md` + conversion log) and the hand-off message flags "license required before `aem.live`".
- [ ] Condensed/narrow display faces fall back to a **condensed** face, not plain Arial (#80): `"<Brand>", "Arial Narrow", arial, …` (or a self-hosted free condensed analog). Width-class is part of classification.
- [ ] Body defaults to a metric-matched system fallback (`arial, sans-serif` for sans brand, `times, "Times New Roman", serif` for serif). `body.session` switches to the brand stack via `var(--font-body)`.
- [ ] An override `@font-face` named after the system font (e.g. `"Arial"`) declares `size-adjust` / `ascent-override` / `descent-override`. For variable brands, lift the calibration from `@fontsource-variable/<name>`; for non-variable brands, **compute** it from the woff2 with fonttools. Result: zero CLS on font swap.
- [ ] No per-block `font-family: var(--font-body)` or `var(--font-display)` declarations. Brand font flows from `body.session` via inheritance. Only mono and serif (Fraunces / Times) families are explicitly set per-block.

## When you finish

Update `stardust/eds-conversion-log.md` (or create one) with: final block inventory, decisions locked, anti-patterns avoided this run, anything site-specific the next person should know. The log is the running history of "why does this look the way it does."
