/**
 * skills/diff/scripts/diff-profiles.mjs
 *
 * Stack profiles for the prototype↔build reconcile probes (content-diff.mjs +
 * visual-diff.mjs). The probe ENGINES are framework-agnostic — they compare two
 * rendered URLs by computed style + DOM. Everything stack-specific lives HERE:
 *   - source/target LABELS used in messages ("proto" → "EDS")
 *   - per-flag REMEDIATION hints (how to fix in this stack)
 *   - a few tunable thresholds + the default content root selector
 *
 * Pick one with `--profile <name>`. `eds` carries the Edge Delivery / DA
 * remediation language + skill finding numbers; `generic` is neutral and works
 * for any prototype↔build comparison (a Figma export vs a React build, a legacy
 * page vs a rebuild). Add a profile by copying `generic` and editing the hints.
 *
 * A flag message is composed as: `${KIND}: ${observation} ${hints[KIND]}` — the
 * engine builds the observation (with real text/dims), the profile supplies the
 * trailing how-to-fix. An empty hint is fine.
