# Edge Delivery Services Operations - Logs

View and manage audit logs for Edge Delivery Services.

## API Reference

| Intent | Endpoint | Method | Required Role |
|--------|----------|--------|---------------|
| view logs | `/log/{org}/{site}/{ref}` | GET | `author`+ (`log:read`) |
| view with filter | `/log/{org}/{site}/{ref}?since={duration}` | GET | `author`+ (`log:read`) |
| view time range | `/log/{org}/{site}/{ref}?from={iso}&to={iso}` | GET | `author`+ (`log:read`) |
| add log entry | `/log/{org}/{site}/{ref}` | POST | `author`+ (`log:write`) |

> **Note:** `basic_author` does NOT have `log:read`. The minimum role for viewing logs is `author`.

## Operations

### View Logs (Default: last 15 minutes)

```bash
curl -s \
  -H "x-auth-token: ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  "https://admin.hlx.page/log/${ORG}/${SITE}/${REF}"
```

**Response shape:** Wrapper object with time bounds and an `entries` array.
```json
{
  "from": "{iso-timestamp}",
  "to": "{iso-timestamp}",
  "entries": [
    {
      "timestamp": 0,
      "method": "POST",
      "route": "preview",
      "path": "/",
      "status": 200,
      "duration": 0,
      "user": "{email}",
      "org": "{org}",
      "site": "{site}",
      "ref": "{ref}"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note:** `timestamp` is a Unix epoch in milliseconds. The `route` field identifies the API surface (e.g. `preview`, `live`, `code`, `preview-job`). Some entries also carry a `job` field linking to a tracked bulk job, or `paths` for bulk requests.

**Present as table:** Timestamp | Method | Route | Path | Status | User

### View Logs with Duration Filter

```bash
# Last hour
curl -s \
  -H "x-auth-token: ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  "https://admin.hlx.page/log/${ORG}/${SITE}/${REF}?since=1h"

# Last 24 hours
curl -s \
  -H "x-auth-token: ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  "https://admin.hlx.page/log/${ORG}/${SITE}/${REF}?since=24h"

# Last 3 days
curl -s \
  -H "x-auth-token: ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  "https://admin.hlx.page/log/${ORG}/${SITE}/${REF}?since=3d"
```

### View Logs with Time Range

```bash
curl -s \
  -H "x-auth-token: ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  "https://admin.hlx.page/log/${ORG}/${SITE}/${REF}?from=2024-01-01T00:00:00Z&to=2024-01-02T00:00:00Z"
```

### Add Log Entry

```bash
curl -s -X POST \
  -H "x-auth-token: ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"entries": [{"event": "Manual deployment completed"}]}' \
  "https://admin.hlx.page/log/${ORG}/${SITE}/${REF}"
```

**Note:** Entries are free-form JSON objects. The `event` field is the standard key for the message. Other custom fields can be added as needed.

## Duration Format

| Format | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `5m` | Last 5 minutes |
| `1h` | Last 1 hour |
| `24h` | Last 24 hours |
| `3d` | Last 3 days |

**Note:** Units are `s` (seconds), `m` (minutes), `h` (hours), `d` (days). If no `since`/`from` is provided, the API defaults to the last 15 minutes.

## Natural Language Patterns

| User Says | Operation |
|-----------|-----------|
| "show logs" | Get logs (last 15 min, default) |
| "show logs from last hour" | Get logs `since=1h` |
| "show logs from last 24 hours" | Get logs `since=24h` |
| "show errors" | Get logs filtered for errors |
| "what happened yesterday" | Get logs `since=24h` |
| "audit log" | Get logs |
| "activity log" | Get logs |

## Pagination

For large log sets, the response includes a `nextToken` and `links.next` URL. To retrieve the next batch:

```bash
NEXT_TOKEN="ABAB=="  # from previous response
curl -s \
  -H "x-auth-token: ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  "https://admin.hlx.page/log/${ORG}/${SITE}/${REF}?nextToken=${NEXT_TOKEN}"
```

Keep following `links.next` until it is absent from the response.
